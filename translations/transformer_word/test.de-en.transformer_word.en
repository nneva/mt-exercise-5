A few years ago, at TED, <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> called "The <unk>."
The idea is pretty easy. <unk> have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> structure with 20 <unk>, about <unk>, about <unk> <unk>, and build a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> has to be <unk>.
And, although it's really <unk>, it's really hard because people <unk> very quickly.
And so I thought that this is an interesting idea, and I've <unk> it into a <unk>.
It was a <unk> success.
<unk>, I did about 70 <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, even with the <unk>, and there's something about this task, and there's something about this job, which is to <unk> <unk> into the nature of the <unk> and I want to share some of it with you.
<unk>, most people <unk> to <unk> themselves.
They talk about it, they're <unk>, what it's going to be.
And then you <unk> a little bit of time and organization, and they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> a lot of their time in the <unk> <unk>.
And finally, before they have no longer time, somebody takes the <unk> and they <unk> it on the top, <unk> a step back and "<unk>!" <unk>, they <unk> their work.
But then, almost always, is that the "<unk>" to a "<unk>," because the weight of the <unk> <unk> that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk>.
There's a number of people who have a lot more "<unk>" <unk> than others, and under the <unk> are <unk>.
They <unk>, they're <unk>, they're <unk> and they're really <unk> <unk>.
And of course, there's a lot more <unk> that have more "<unk>" <unk> and under the <unk> are <unk> of the <unk>.
And that's pretty amazing.
As we <unk>, they're not just <unk> the <unk>, but they also <unk> the <unk> structure of all.
What they might be asking is, how does that? What about them?
And <unk> tells us, "<unk> of children <unk> time to be the <unk> <unk>."
They don't spend time in <unk>.
But there's another reason.
And that <unk> <unk> were <unk> to find a <unk> plan, <unk>!
And then <unk> it.
What happens when they <unk> the <unk> on the top, they don't have time and what happens?
It's a crisis.
<unk> <unk>, what?
What <unk> are doing different is that they start with the <unk> and <unk>, <unk> <unk>, always with the <unk>, so they have the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, this kind of <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And with any trial will get the kids <unk> <unk>, which doesn't work.
So the <unk> to work with <unk>, <unk> -- but let's see how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> for most of the <unk> is about <unk>, <unk> half of them, <unk> something more, but not much, <unk> are better than the <unk>.
Who is <unk>?
<unk> and <unk>, for happiness.
<unk> is the <unk> of what I've seen.
And why? Because they understand <unk> and <unk> patterns are the key to build <unk> structures.
<unk> are something about <unk>. But here it's interesting.
If you <unk> a <unk> on the team, they're going to be better.
It's incredible. You see, and it's <unk>, "This team is <unk>."
You can <unk> that. Why is that?
Because they have <unk> <unk>.
They <unk> the process, they understand it
And <unk> team, the <unk> and the <unk> is going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk> skills and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk>.
If you have 10 <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, you get about six that have <unk> structures.
Now I tried to <unk>.
I thought we were going to take the <unk> <unk>.
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to software <unk>.
What do you think about this <unk>?
What was the result?
This happened. Not a team had a <unk> structure.
If <unk> <unk> had built a <unk> <unk>, he would have the price <unk> home.
So is it not interesting that high <unk> <unk> have a <unk> <unk>
We <unk> these <unk> students.
What do you think happened?
Now understood the advantage of the <unk>.
This is how <unk> was <unk>, bad team of a <unk> under the best.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> time.
There are <unk> <unk> for us, about nature of <unk> and success.
You might ask, why would someone actually <unk> a <unk> <unk>?
The reason is that I have <unk> tools and <unk> tools to help <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and "<unk> <unk>."
And what the <unk> is doing, it helps them <unk> <unk>.
Because <unk>, every project has its own <unk>.
The challenge is <unk> a common experience to build a common language of <unk>.
And this is the value of this experience, this simple <unk>.
And those of you who are interested in, can <unk> <unk>.
It's a <unk> where you see the <unk> <unk>.
There's a <unk> there.
They're <unk> examples of the world, like people <unk> the system and <unk>.
There's also <unk>.
And the <unk> <unk>, I think the <unk> actually is a <unk> <unk>.
It <unk> that we all our <unk> to the task, and that we think we use our thinking, how our feelings and our <unk>, in the challenge that <unk> us.
And sometimes a little <unk> of this experience everything that it takes to be to take us from a "<unk>" -- to a "<unk>" <unk>.
And this can make a big difference.
Thank you.
<unk> we would have a machine.
It's a big machine, <unk> machine, and this is a <unk> machine.
And everyone in this room has to go in.
And you can go to the past, you can't go into the future; you can't go in and now.
And I wonder what you would choose, because I've <unk> my friends in a long time often <unk> this question, and they wanted to go to the past.
I don't know. They wanted to go back in time, before cars or "America or" America to <unk> the <unk>. "
I don't know.
I believe that you're kind of <unk>, is to <unk> <unk>.
And I <unk>.
I'm not part of this group, I have to say.
I don't want to be in the past, and I don't, because I'm a <unk>.
It's because of that possibilities don't go back, they go back.
So I want to go into this machine, and I want to go into the future.
This is the most <unk> time that we've ever <unk> on the planet, no matter what <unk> you: health, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There was never a time before.
And my <unk> <unk> all when they were 60.
My <unk>, this number of <unk>.
My parents are the 80 on the <unk>.
So there should be a nine <unk> at the beginning of my <unk>.
But it's not about people like us, because this is a bigger thing.
A child who can be born in <unk> today, as long as the <unk> man in the world's <unk> 100 years ago.
Think about it. This is an incredible fact.
And why is that?
The <unk>. The <unk> have killed billion people on this planet.
They have the <unk> of the Earth in a way that doesn't ever have a war.
They're gone. They're <unk>.
We <unk> them. <unk>.
In the <unk> world there are diseases that have millions of us only before one another generation, <unk>.
<unk>, <unk>, <unk>...
Now, you know, what this is?
<unk>, <unk> medicine, our ability to <unk> billion people, which are the <unk> of <unk>.
And in my view, the scientific way, things are looking at whether it works, if it doesn't do it, if it doesn't, one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
So that's the good news.
<unk>, it's already the whole good news, because there's some other problems, and they were <unk>.
And one of them is that, despite all of our <unk> a billion people in the world every day to bed.
This number is <unk>, and they're <unk> very quickly, and this is <unk>.
And not just that, we have our <unk> <unk> to <unk> this world.
<unk>, <unk> land, oil, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and if we don't <unk> from this <unk> <unk>, and if we don't <unk> from this <unk> <unk>.
So the question is: Can we do that? I think.
I think it's clear that we can produce food that's <unk> billion people, without the land on them.
I think we can <unk> this world with energy that they don't <unk> at the same time.
I believe that really, and no, that's not a <unk>.
But this is <unk> me <unk> -- one of the things that <unk> <unk> me. We have never <unk> progress in the same way that we've never <unk> as <unk>, even as <unk>, <unk>.
And we've never been able to <unk> it, <unk> <unk>, as we can now.
We're at the <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> on many <unk>, and yet, I really think that we have hundreds of, 300 years before the <unk>, 300 years ago, we have <unk> progress in which we have <unk> progress that we have <unk> about these things that are more <unk> than now.
The people <unk> in their faith, so that you can't <unk> them.
Not even the truth will <unk> it.
And you hear, everyone is a right to <unk>, even a right to your mind, <unk>.
But you know, don't you know what?
They're not right on their own <unk>. '<unk>, you don't.
And I have a <unk> <unk> to figure this out.
<unk> a <unk> ago, I've written on <unk> for "The New <unk>," a little <unk>. "
And I was <unk> to <unk> on <unk>, on <unk>, on <unk> to what was the end of the <unk> <unk> in the history of humanity.
I didn't know what I should do, so I just did what I do, and I wrote an <unk> and <unk>.
And soon, I wrote a <unk> about <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The same thing, just bigger.
People <unk> crazy.
So I also wrote about it a <unk>, and I couldn't understand why people thought that that would be, "<unk>," why they <unk> that <unk> in a certain way, instead of <unk> a <unk> <unk> in nature.
But you know, I do what I do. I wrote the <unk>, I <unk> on.
I mean, I'm <unk>.
We <unk>, we <unk>, we go, we go to eat, that's okay.
But this <unk> made me worry, and I couldn't figure out why, and then I found it.
And that's because these <unk> that these <unk> that made me crazy at all.
These were <unk> people, <unk> people, <unk>.
They were just like the people in this room.
And that made me so <unk>...
But then I thought, you know what we're <unk>.
We're <unk> at a point where we don't have the <unk> <unk> for progress.
We're talking about it.
We're talking about it with a little <unk> about: "<unk>."
Okay, so there are reasons, and I think we know what reasons they are.
We have trust in institutions, in <unk>, in <unk>, and sometimes in science is lost, and there's no reason why it should be.
You can just call a few name, and people will understand.
<unk>, <unk>, the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> <unk>.
I mean, you can choose their own list.
There are questions and problems with the people that we <unk> that they would always be right. <unk>.
<unk> questions, <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
Take nothing more than <unk>.
But now, if you're going to get <unk>, you have to <unk> this <unk>, and we're not good at it.
And I can say that for the reason that we now live in a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, as I've never seen them, and hopefully see again.
It was published about 12 years ago, a story that was published with the <unk> <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Very <unk>.
<unk> studies have been done to see if the <unk>.
<unk> studies should be done, and this is a <unk> <unk>.
The data came <unk>.
The data came from the United States, from <unk>, from <unk>, from <unk>, from <unk>, and they were all right, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>, no <unk>
It makes no difference. It doesn't matter because we believe in <unk>, we believe what we see to believe what we see is that we feel real.
We don't believe in a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> us, and I think that, I think we all.
But you know what?
The result of that was <unk>.
<unk> because of that fact, the United States is one of the only of the world in which the <unk> for <unk> <unk>.
This is <unk>, and we should be <unk>.
It's <unk>.
What happened is that we could.
Well, I <unk> that. I do.
Because here's a <unk>?
<unk> a <unk> in the audience ever see someone <unk> die of <unk>?
It's not very often.
<unk> in this country, not at all, but <unk> times in the world in the last year.
These are <unk> by <unk>, 20 hour.
But because this is not happening here, we can <unk> it, and people like <unk> <unk> and <unk> of fear and <unk> of fear and <unk> of fear and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And they can do that because they don't connect <unk> and <unk>.
They don't understand that these things seem to be the same, but it's never <unk>.
And this is something that we need to learn, and it's very quickly.
This guy was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> us from one of the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
No fear, no <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>.
The guy in the middle.
It's called Paul <unk>.
He's <unk> with a few other people.
He can save the life of <unk>, <unk> children a year in the developing world.
<unk> good, right?
Now that's good, <unk> of that Paul <unk> and talks about <unk> and says, how <unk> they are, and that people should just stop.
And it's actually saying that.
So Paul is a <unk>.
If Paul <unk> in a public <unk>, it can't <unk> without <unk> <unk>.
He gets <unk> at home because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school.
And why? Because Paul did a <unk>.
I don't need that, but <unk> are <unk>.
If you <unk> them, <unk> the diseases back, <unk> diseases, and that's what's happening.
We've <unk> in this country now.
And that's going to be worse, and pretty soon children die of it, because that's just a question of the numbers.
And they're not just going to die of <unk>.
What about <unk>? We're going to do that. Why not?
A <unk> of me, a couple of weeks ago, and I believe I'm a little too <unk>.
No one has ever said that before.
She would not be <unk> her child <unk>.
<unk>.
Why? Because we don't have <unk>. And you know what?
We had not <unk> in this country.
Today, I don't know, maybe <unk> someone in <unk> in <unk>, and in <unk> <unk> to <unk>, at the moment, he's over <unk>.
And in a few hours, he <unk>, and he <unk> a car, and he comes to <unk> one of those <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And he doesn't know that he's <unk> with a <unk> disease, and we don't know that, because that's how it works.
This is the planet that we live on. <unk> not like it.
We love to <unk>. We love that.
Have you taken all the morning your <unk>?
<unk>, a little <unk> that helps you on the <unk>.
I know you've done this because half of the Americans every day.
They take the stuff, and they take <unk> <unk>, and it doesn't matter how often we find out they are <unk>.
The data is constantly <unk>.
They're <unk> your <unk>. <unk> do it almost never.
That's okay, you'd like to pay <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> up all of you.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I <unk> -- we <unk> the <unk>.
We <unk> a strong government. We don't have trust in the system.
And we should not. Our <unk> is <unk>.
It's <unk> to millions of people.
It's absolutely amazing <unk> and <unk> ourselves that can afford it.
So we walk away from it, and where are we going?
We walk into the <unk> of <unk>.
This is <unk>. I love the <unk>.
But you know, this is a really <unk> <unk>, because the stuff is <unk>, and we give billions of dollars for it.
And I have all kinds of little <unk> here.
<unk> of that -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, because I don't even know what this is, but we give billions of dollars to it is <unk>.
And you know what? If I say that, when I say that people are <unk> me and say, "What is it <unk>? <unk> people do, what do they want.
So they feel good. "
And you know what? They have <unk>.
Because I don't care if it's the <unk>, who says, "<unk>, I'm going to <unk> the <unk> of my <unk>," or <unk> <unk>, who wants to treat his patients.
If you look at this way, where <unk> and <unk> <unk> and science, <unk> and science, you one place where you don't want to be.
They go to <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
He <unk> his people, because he <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk>, <unk> and <unk> are much more <unk> than <unk> drugs that we know that they can <unk> the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in a country that's worse than any other one of this disease.
<unk> me that these things don't have <unk> <unk>.
They have them. They have.
Now, the <unk> <unk>, where we're on, is this <unk> <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk>.
It's a <unk> <unk>. It has to stop.
It's a <unk> about words, about <unk>.
This is <unk>, not science.
<unk> that we eat, every <unk>, every <unk>, every <unk>, was <unk> by the people.
You know, there was no <unk> in the <unk>.
There was no <unk>. There was no <unk>. We did all that.
We've done it in the last <unk> years.
And <unk> of it worked and <unk> doesn't work.
We are <unk>, which didn't work.
Now we can do it as well. And of course there's <unk>, but we can do something like <unk> A in <unk> B, and the stuff can help millions of people to <unk> their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say that I don't.
We <unk> <unk> food.
Why do we do that?
Now, what I <unk> is all the time to do is <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, we don't want a huge <unk> <unk> with one thing, which is wrong.
We don't want companies to <unk> life.
We don't want companies to have <unk>.
And you know, what my answer is this?
Yeah, you're right. Let's do that.
It's true, we have a <unk> <unk>, but this is not science.
It has nothing to do with science.
It's right, <unk>, <unk>.
You know that science is not a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it's not working, but the idea that we should not allow science to do not allow us to do because we're afraid to be afraid to do because we're afraid is a <unk> <unk>, and it <unk> million people from <unk>.
You know, in the next 50 years, we have to be <unk> <unk> than that, 70 percent.
These <unk> in Africa in the last 30 years.
<unk>. <unk>.
They need that, and we don't give them.
And why? <unk> food.
We don't want people to eat this <unk> stuff, like <unk>.
<unk> is something that <unk> a billion people eat.
It's like a <unk>.
It's just a <unk> <unk>. It's <unk>.
It has no <unk>, it doesn't have a <unk>, and scientists build all this in it.
And then people could eat it, and they wouldn't be <unk>.
You wouldn't <unk>, and you know what?
It would be <unk>. It wasn't <unk>, but it would be beautiful.
And everything I can say about this is: Why do we <unk> that?
I mean, we ask ourselves: Why do we <unk> that?
Because we don't want to <unk> genes?
It's not about <unk> genes. It's not about <unk>.
It's not about our <unk> passion for <unk>, our <unk>, our <unk> <unk>, <unk> food.
It's not about <unk> <unk>, it's about <unk> <unk>, and it's going to be <unk> time to understand what that means.
Because you know what?
If we don't do that when we do so on how far we do something that we do, I believe, I don't want to be <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
There's no other <unk> for what's happening here.
It's <unk>, it's <unk>, it's our <unk>, and we need to <unk> that.
So after this incredibly <unk> <unk> <unk>, you might say, "You're still <unk> into this <unk> and go into the future?"
<unk>, I want to do it in any case.
At the moment, it's in the <unk>, but we have an incredible opportunity.
We can put this <unk> on everything we want.
We can <unk> them where we want to <unk> them, and we will move them where we want.
We have to <unk> this <unk>, and we need to think, but when we go into the <unk> and go into the future, we're going to be <unk> to have it.
I know that we can do it, and it's a little bit about what the world needs now.
Thank you. Thank you
As a <unk> <unk>, <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>, one day through the streets in <unk> <unk>, he heard a <unk> music.
She came from a man, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, who was on a <unk> <unk> that had just two <unk>.
A lot of you will know the story, because of <unk> <unk> was a book that was <unk> <unk>, which was <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> career of its <unk> early <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> a <unk> and 30 years later, he lived as <unk> on the streets of <unk> <unk> in the middle of <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> you all to read <unk> 's book or <unk> the film, so that you don't just understand the beautiful <unk> that were <unk> between these two men, but also how the music that <unk> and how it was finally <unk> when the <unk> is allowed this <unk> to be <unk> by the street.
I met <unk> <unk> in <unk>, two years ago, in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He had just heard a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and came behind the stage to <unk>.
He <unk> in a very <unk>, and he <unk> sound about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and <unk> <unk>, and how the <unk> would <unk> it never into the <unk> <unk>, and that all of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We came to <unk> music, and a few days later, I got a <unk>, where I got a <unk>, where I got a <unk>, and a few days later, I got
I have to <unk> that <unk> a medical treatment, because it was already <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, a <unk> that has been <unk> with <unk> and <unk>, a <unk> that has <unk> his life.
And as a result of this, it's particularly <unk> for these <unk> <unk>, and they're sometimes so <unk> that they <unk> it to <unk>, and it <unk> <unk>, in the streets of <unk> <unk>, and <unk> his own <unk>.
And in exactly the same way a <unk> <unk>, when we started with our first <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and <unk> completely lost.
He talked about <unk> <unk> and <unk>, and he <unk> about how someone in the <unk> <unk>.
I was afraid, not <unk>, but I was afraid that I could lose him that he could lose that he could <unk> into one of his <unk> and that I could <unk> him to <unk> his relationship if I <unk> to <unk> and <unk> other <unk> forms of <unk> <unk>.
So I just started playing.
I <unk> the first <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
And while I was <unk>, I realized that in <unk> eyes was a <unk> <unk>.
It was, as if it was a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, whose <unk> was my game.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in understanding, into a <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
And like through a <unk>, he took his <unk> and started to play a few <unk> of <unk> and then <unk> me to play them, and then <unk> me to play them: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>
We then <unk> to talk about music, started talking about <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and all the other <unk>, from <unk> to <unk>.
And I realized that it wasn't just a <unk> knowledge of music, but it with her a <unk> <unk> relationship.
He talked about her with a passion and an understanding that I else just my colleagues in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He <unk> music, and he talked about music, was from this <unk>, <unk> man who was <unk> by the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, in <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is medicine. <unk> <unk> us.
For <unk> music, <unk> health.
Because the music allows him to <unk> his <unk> and <unk> with his help his <unk> and creativity in something <unk>.
And so he <unk> his <unk>.
I <unk> that this is the nature of art.
That's the reason why we make music: that we make something that in all of us, in the <unk>, our feelings, through our <unk>, through our <unk> <unk>, through our creativity to reality.
And the reality <unk> is <unk> all of us, inspired and <unk> us.
What <unk> <unk>, so it took the music back into a community of friends.
The <unk> force of music brought it back into a family of <unk> that <unk> him, who <unk> his <unk>, who realized his <unk> and <unk> it.
And I'm going to <unk> over and over again with <unk>, whether in <unk> <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk>, because he <unk> me why I have become <unk>.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>: Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk>: I want to play something that I <unk> the <unk> <unk>.
I hope you will <unk>.
I'm <unk> <unk>. I <unk> <unk>.
I've been <unk> <unk> for 10 years, and my goal is to be able to do it as easy to save the world in reality as it is to save.
I have a plan for that. I want to <unk> more people, <unk> all of you to <unk> more time with games and <unk> games.
We're going to spend three billion hours a week.
Some of you may think, "That's a lot of time for games."
<unk> a little too much time when you're <unk> like many problems we have <unk> in the real world.
But in fact, my research on the <unk> of the future, is exactly the opposite.
Three billion hours per week are not <unk> enough to solve the <unk> of the world.
In fact, I believe that if we want to survive the next century, we have to <unk> <unk> that time.
I've <unk> that the <unk> time at <unk> billion hours a week.
And that's first <unk> a little bit of a <unk>, so I <unk> it can <unk>: If we're <unk> problems like <unk>, poverty, global <unk> and <unk> to solve, I think we're trying to games online for at least <unk> billion hours a week.
<unk> to play the next <unk>. No, no, I mean it really seriously.
Why? This picture
Why I believe that games are so <unk> for the <unk> of the human species in the future.
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
He wanted to <unk> the feelings of games, so he <unk> a camera.
This is one of the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you're not a <unk>, you may some of the <unk> in this picture.
You probably see this <unk> for <unk>, but also, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> into the <unk> of a real <unk>.
If you're playing, you see some <unk> here that are <unk> up and the <unk> are a <unk> of <unk>. The <unk>
This is a <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Oh, you know that. OK.
So we have some <unk> here.
A <unk> <unk> is a result that's so <unk> <unk> that you didn't know it was possible at all.
It was <unk> <unk> of <unk>. And when you do it, you're <unk>.
And in fact, that you're <unk>. This is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And this is what we have to see on millions of <unk> <unk> around the world, when we have to take the <unk> of the next century, and the <unk>, the face, the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk>, unfortunately, we're more <unk> to the real problems in life when we're <unk> <unk> problems.
I <unk> it as the "in life, I'm <unk>."
And it's actually my face, see? Yes? OK.
I'm like, "In life I'm <unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "
This is a <unk> in my <unk> in <unk>, California, California, where I'm in my <unk> <unk> why we are in games better than in real life.
This is a problem that's a lot of <unk>.
We think that we're not in reality, we're not as good as games.
And I'm not just <unk>, even though that's heard it.
We're <unk> in <unk>.
I mean, I mean, in the context of <unk>, inspired to <unk> with each other
If we're in a <unk>, I believe that many of us are <unk> in our best version, <unk> and immediately are <unk>, <unk> and immediately <unk> the problem to <unk> the way it takes to <unk> for the <unk>.
And in reality, when we <unk>, when we <unk> <unk>, we feel a lot differently.
We feel <unk>. We feel <unk>. We feel <unk>. We feel <unk>, maybe <unk> or <unk> or <unk>.
These feelings we never have, if we play, in play, in games there are no way.
And that's what I wanted to do as a <unk>.
<unk> is it impossible to think, if you can't get it just <unk>?
How can we <unk> those feelings of play into play?
So I looked at games like <unk> of <unk>, which is <unk> the <unk> environment.
And I've <unk> some things that are <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>.
So first, if you <unk> in one of these <unk>, especially at <unk> of <unk>, there's a lot of <unk> <unk> that are willing to you a <unk> <unk> <unk>, and it immediately.
But not just <unk> <unk>, but a <unk> that <unk> perfect to your <unk> in the game, right?
So you're going to do that.
You never get a job that you can't solve.
But always the <unk> of your <unk>, so you have to <unk>.
But there's no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>, and you don't sit there and <unk>, there's always a very <unk>.
And there are <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, too, people who are <unk> with you to <unk> your <unk> <unk>.
We don't have that easy to be <unk> in <unk> life, this sense that in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And also, there's this <unk> story, this <unk> story, why we're there and what we're doing, and then we <unk> all this <unk>.
You've <unk> by "<unk>" and "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" or "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>" <unk>. "
This <unk> <unk>, there's not <unk> life.
If I <unk> this stage, I didn't, <unk> 1 <unk>, and <unk> 1 <unk> <unk> <unk> idea, 20 <unk> idea.
I don't <unk> this <unk> life.
So the problem of <unk> like <unk> of <unk> of <unk> is that it's so <unk>, <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk>, that we rather than spend our whole time in this <unk>.
They're just better than reality.
<unk> today, all of the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> million years to solve the <unk> problems of <unk>.
It's not <unk> something.
It might sound <unk>.
But to see it in the context: <unk> million years ago, our first <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the first <unk> <unk>.
OK, so when we talk about how much time we spend <unk> <unk> with games, which makes sense to <unk> when you think is <unk> the <unk> of the human development, eyes <unk> in front of the human development of the human development of the human evolution of the human development, which is <unk>.
But also <unk>, because it turns out that we use all these time <unk> games, actually change that we're able to <unk> as humans.
We're <unk> to <unk> <unk>, <unk> creatures.
That's the truth. I believe that.
<unk> this interesting <unk> that recently <unk> by a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>: the <unk> young people in a country with <unk> <unk> <unk> 10,000 hours with <unk> to the <unk>.
So, 10,000 hours, a <unk> interesting number, two reasons.
First, for children in the United States, <unk> hours the <unk> <unk> they're going to school, from <unk> to <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- if you never <unk>. So we've got a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, on the young people are learning as to be a good <unk>, how to be a good <unk>, how everything else they learn in school.
And maybe some of you have the new book of <unk> <unk>, "<unk>," read, "<unk>," Well, you know his theory of <unk>, the theory of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
It's based on the <unk> of <unk> research that if we're going to <unk> 10,000 hours with the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk>, we're going to <unk> in it.
We're going to be as well to do what the <unk> people in the world.
So, what we have here is a <unk> generation of people who are <unk>.
So the big question is, "<unk> <unk> are <unk> good?"
Because if we could find out that, we could never have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So many people have <unk> in the world that at least one hour per hour.
These are our <unk>. 500 million people who are good in "<unk>."
And in the next <unk>, we have another billion <unk>, which is good in whatever.
If you don't hear it yet.
The <unk> developed <unk>, the energy <unk> and working on <unk>, instead of the <unk>, so that <unk> all over the world, especially in India, China, <unk> online.
You expect a billion <unk> in the next <unk>.
We have <unk> <unk> billion <unk>.
So I started to <unk> what it is to do to <unk> what it is to
Here's the four things that I found. As a <unk>: <unk>.
OK, imagine how <unk> <unk>.
<unk> is the <unk> to do something immediately is to do a <unk>, with the belief that we have a <unk> <unk> of hope.
<unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible, and it's always <unk> to it, and it's going to be <unk>.
<unk> are not sitting around.
<unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
There's a lot of <unk> <unk> that show that we might more people, after we have <unk> with them, even when they <unk> us <unk>.
The reason is that it's a lot of trust with someone.
We <unk> that we have <unk> to <unk> that the rules that we're <unk> the rules that we have the same goal and <unk> to the <unk>.
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, trust and <unk>.
As a result, we <unk> social relationships.
<unk> <unk>. <unk>!
You know, there's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week, so I think, as <unk>.
The reason is that when we play, we're actually <unk> to work hard when we're <unk> or nothing.
We know that we <unk> as human beings <unk> work when we <unk>, <unk> work.
And <unk> are always ready to work hard when they get the right thing.
And finally, <unk> meaning.
<unk> love it to be part of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Here's a <unk> <unk> to <unk> the light, and you're <unk> all <unk>, the largest <unk>, the largest <unk> <unk> in the world.
The <unk> <unk> in the world, <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
<unk> million people use it every month.
They have more information about the <unk> of <unk> on the <unk> of the Internet than about <unk> in any other <unk> in the world.
They create a <unk> story.
They're creating a <unk> source of <unk> about the <unk> of <unk>.
OK, so these are four <unk> that lead to a single result, <unk> individuals.
They are people who believe that they can change the world as <unk>.
And the only problem is they believe, they can change the <unk>, but not the <unk>.
That's the problem that I try to solve.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk>.
His work is <unk>. He <unk> why.
<unk> so much time, energy and money in <unk>.
And he says, "We're not going to be <unk> by <unk> and <unk>."
And that's <unk>. So it's <unk>.
And he says... Not the way I... I'm <unk> games, I'm a little <unk>.
So he says, the <unk> actually make sense, because <unk> can reach more than in real life.
You can <unk> social <unk> than in real life, and they get more <unk> and <unk> in play as a real life.
So, he says it's completely <unk> that <unk> more time in the <unk> world than in the real world.
And I just <unk>, this is <unk>.
But it's not <unk>.
We need to start by <unk> the real world.
My <unk> comes from a <unk> that <unk> years.
There's this <unk> <unk>, from <unk>. You know?
There was <unk> <unk>.
And that was kind of <unk> the first of people developed <unk>, and if you're <unk> with the <unk> of the old <unk> <unk>, you might know this story, and why games were invented.
<unk> <unk> have been <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk>.
In <unk>, there was a <unk> big <unk> that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to an <unk> idea.
People <unk>. People <unk>.
It was a <unk> situation. It took a <unk> solution.
So they <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>, and one day you would eat.
And they would be so much in the <unk> <unk>, because games are so <unk> and <unk> us with <unk>, <unk> <unk> that they would forget that they would forget that there was nothing to eat.
And then the next day, you would play. And the next day, you would eat.
And they <unk> <unk> for 18 years, they <unk> these <unk> <unk> for 18 years, and the next <unk>.
<unk>, I think we're games today.
We're playing games to <unk> the <unk> of the real world, and we're <unk> games to <unk> everything that in the real world is not <unk>, and <unk> in real life is not <unk>, and we're <unk> what we need from play.
But that doesn't have to be the end.
That's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, 18 years, the <unk> didn't work better, so the <unk> of the <unk>, one last <unk>.
They <unk> the <unk> in two <unk>.
They <unk> a <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
They were <unk> and they were looking for a new <unk>, and they were just <unk> so many people back, and they were <unk> to the rest of a <unk> that they could <unk>.
That sounds crazy, right?
But <unk> <unk> show that the <unk> <unk> that later <unk> <unk> <unk>, the same DNA as the old <unk> <unk>.
And so scientists recently came to <unk> that <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk>.
And <unk> <unk> found a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years, which is going to explain.
So this <unk> story could <unk>.
They may actually have their <unk> through games by games by <unk> themselves for 18 years in games, and then they had these <unk>, and so much about the <unk> play, and so much about the <unk> that <unk> them by <unk> the entire <unk>.
So we can.
We've been <unk> in <unk>.
This was the first <unk> in <unk>.
It was the <unk> of <unk>. It was 16 years ago.
They <unk> for 18 years, we've been <unk> for 16 years.
I <unk>, we're ready for our own <unk>.
So, they <unk> half of their <unk> <unk> to look for a new world, so I <unk> my <unk> billion <unk> per week.
We should <unk> in that half of us an hour a day with games, until we <unk> the problems of the real world.
I know you're going to ask, "How do we solve the real world.
in play? "And that question, I've been <unk> my work in the last few years.
We have this <unk> in our office in <unk> <unk>, it's <unk> of how we should understand the future.
We don't want to try to tell the future before.
What we want is to do the future.
We want to think about the <unk> <unk>, and then people to <unk> this idea in reality.
We're <unk> <unk> and give people the opportunity to reach them.
So I'm going to show you three games that I have <unk> to try to <unk> people in their own future.
This is "world without oil."
The game is about <unk>.
It's a <unk> where you have to <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is invented, but we have <unk> <unk> <unk> so that it's <unk> for you, and you <unk> your <unk> life without oil. So, if you look at the game, let's say, where you <unk>. And then you get <unk> in <unk> that show you how much oil is <unk>,
As <unk>, whether schools are <unk> whether schools are <unk> whether it's <unk>, and you have to figure out how to make your <unk> life if it were true, and we ask you about it, <unk> or <unk> <unk>.
We've <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk>, and we've <unk> them over the last three years.
And I can tell you, it was a <unk> experience.
No one wants to change his life because it's good for the environment or because we should.
But if you're in a <unk> <unk>, and I said, "<unk> goes the oil."
This is a <unk> <unk> that you go.
<unk> out how you would survive, and most of our <unk> have <unk> <unk> in the game.
So we've <unk> for the next <unk> <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>.
We've developed "<unk>" on the <unk> <unk> for the future.
<unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> that people have only <unk> years on the planet.
This <unk> is called "<unk> <unk> <unk>, of course.
The <unk> of <unk>, <unk>, we have almost like a "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>.
You know <unk> <unk>, where there's the <unk> <unk>, and they have the <unk>, the scientists, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> and only together they can save the world.
But in our game, instead of just five people, we say, everybody is in the <unk>, and it's our job, health, security and security and the future of the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> the game <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for weeks.
They found 500 incredibly <unk> solutions that you can <unk> when you "<unk>" <unk> "<unk>."
And the last game we <unk> on the <unk> <unk>, and it's a game in <unk> with the <unk>.
If you <unk> the game, you get from the <unk> "<unk> <unk>," <unk> <unk>. "
We're working with <unk> and <unk> them to learn a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
We have a <unk> on it. We've <unk> "<unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, vision and <unk> and <unk>.
I'd like to share all of you to share this game with young people all over the world, especially in <unk>, who are <unk> together to save their own social <unk> to save the world.
So I'm going to go to the end.
I want to ask you something.
What, do you think happens when <unk>?
We have all these <unk>, we have games that show us what we can do, but we don't have the real world yet.
<unk>, I hope that you're <unk> to me that <unk> human resources that we can use to work in real life, and that games have a lot of change.
We've <unk> all these <unk>, <unk> <unk>, the ability to <unk> social <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and the <unk> of <unk>.
And I really hope that we play <unk> together to survive on this planet.
And I hope you will be able to do these games and play.
If I go to the next <unk>, I'm sure in two things: that we can make any future of <unk>, and that we can play all kinds of games games. So I say, the <unk> games are beginning.
<unk>.
I've been <unk> for a while, I've been interested in the <unk>, and it might be <unk> interested in it, because, you look at it like me, "a <unk> that will be <unk> to something when you think is just enough."
In other words, <unk> in some studies have shown a <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, and just <unk>, because the person thinks what's happening with her, is a <unk> or a kind of -- in the <unk>, for example, there's a <unk> <unk>, for example, there's a <unk> <unk> in the body that you call.
A <unk> is going to be <unk> because someone like that.
So we're also <unk> to understand you now, I want to show you a <unk>, very simple <unk>.
And I'm going to show you how it works, and this is a <unk> that has at least <unk> in every <unk> for children.
And I myself, I've learned that the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> it for you, and I'll explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I <unk> it.
So, look what happens.
The <unk> that you can study.
I'm just going to be <unk> in my <unk>.
I <unk> my <unk>.
And to make sure that nothing in my <unk> <unk> or <unk>, I'm just going to <unk> my <unk> right here.
And that's how you can see that there's no time in any time, and I'm <unk> here, nothing in my <unk> or <unk>.
And the goal is quite simple.
I'm going to open open my hand, and hopefully if everything goes well, the <unk> is <unk> through my <unk> <unk>.
It actually <unk> in the place that I can <unk> it, without <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> in my <unk> or comes out, no <unk>, and you can study everything.
<unk>!
Well, this is a <unk> that I often <unk> little kids that are interested in <unk>, because you can learn a lot about <unk>, if you look at <unk>, even though it's a very <unk>.
<unk>, many of you know here in the <unk> of this <unk>.
He works <unk>.
I think the <unk> in my hand.
I say that I <unk> my <unk> <unk> to <unk> that nothing in my <unk> <unk> or <unk>, and that's a <unk>.
The reason I <unk> my <unk>, is that in the <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
Because at the moment, where I <unk> my hand from you so that you can see them from <unk>, my <unk>, just from there, my <unk>, just from where he was, in a position where it's so <unk>.
<unk> <unk>?
There was somebody who was not a childhood.
So, it's right here. Right.
And when I look at it, the <unk> changes its position.
And now you could talk about why this is a <unk>, why you're not <unk> that there's just three <unk>: because the <unk> and the way it <unk> the <unk> and the way it <unk> information, not <unk>, one, one, two, three, but they as a group.
But it's all about it right now. And then I <unk> my hand.
Of course, it's <unk> there, but not through the <unk> of my body, but through a <unk>, through my <unk>, which is there.
And when I <unk> my hand, it's going on the same same thing by <unk> me is <unk> by <unk> the movement that the <unk> <unk>.
I take this hand away. And here's the <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, you can <unk> your friends and <unk>. Thank you.
Now, what has this <unk> to do with the <unk>?
A year ago or so I read a study that was really <unk>.
I'm not a doctor or <unk>, and therefore, that was an amazing thing to me.
And so here's what's <unk>: If you <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk>, which is just a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, which has a certain <unk> <unk>.
But if you look at the shape where you're <unk> the <unk>, for example, in a <unk> <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> and a <unk> on it, it's actually <unk> <unk>.
And that, although not <unk> <unk> -- it's just <unk>.
But a <unk> <unk> is not as good as a <unk> <unk>.
What? That was really <unk> me.
But it turned out that it's not all.
If you take <unk>, they're <unk>, they're <unk> as <unk>.
A <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> at a end, and on other <unk>, is better than a <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> is also <unk> a role.
A <unk> <unk> <unk> is not as well as three <unk> -- I can't <unk> me to the <unk> <unk>.
But the <unk> is.
... that the <unk> play a role.
And the shape is playing a role.
And if you want to have the <unk> <unk>, you have to <unk> <unk>.
<unk>? A <unk> with a <unk> -- some <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> that you <unk> a patient.
It's created a very <unk> picture in the head. This is much more <unk> than a <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> is really... I'm going to show you a different time when we have a <unk> <unk>.
So the fact is that the <unk> <unk> is not as well as the <unk> <unk>, which is not as well as the <unk> <unk>.
And there's nothing about it really <unk>, and it's just our <unk> on the <unk> <unk>.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a <unk>.
I <unk> something that is a <unk>, and it's what it looks like.
And we know that from <unk> study that you have to <unk> <unk> when it's supposed to go.
This is a 18 <unk> long <unk>. It's very, very <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> them a little bit.
This is really my <unk>. It's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is my skin. This is not a <unk> from <unk>.
I'm going to <unk> these <unk> into my skin, and through them <unk>, until they <unk> on the other side.
If you're <unk> -- if you're <unk> in <unk> -- I've got this a few friends at night in <unk>, and some people I don't <unk>, and it's almost almost <unk>.
So I <unk> if you're <unk> quickly, you look for the next 30 seconds, or have, you know what I'm going to do the first <unk> part here.
You can see it in a moment, but also if you want.
So, this is what's going on, right here where my <unk> <unk>, at the <unk> part of my <unk>, I'm just going to make a little <unk>.
<unk> me. <unk> you. <unk> that?
And just a little through my skin and on the other side of that.
Now we're actually in the same situation that we had <unk>.
<unk>.
But now can't you <unk> my <unk>, right?
So, I'm going to show you. This is one, two, three, four, five.
Well, you know.
I know what people think when they see this.
They say, "Okay, that's not so <unk> and <unk> itself the skin, just to <unk> us a few minutes."
Now, I'm going to show you.
What does this look like? <unk> good.
Yeah, I know. And people <unk> say, "Okay. I don't see that right."
People in the <unk> now.
Let me show you that from close.
It's really my skin. It's not a <unk> of <unk>.
This is my <unk>, and I can <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> me. If you're <unk>, look away, look away, don't go.
The people <unk> or those who are looking at this point at a video, will say, "Well, well, that looks pretty <unk>, but if it were real, it would be <unk>, but if it was really real, it would be <unk>."
Okay, let me <unk> a little blood for you.
Yes, here it.
<unk>, I would <unk> the <unk>.
I would <unk> my arm and show you that there's no <unk>.
But I think in this <unk>, and with the <unk>, from a <unk> to make a <unk>, I'm just going to <unk> the <unk> and <unk>.
We're going to <unk> in the next days.
I hope you're <unk>. Thank you so much.
So I <unk> a lot of <unk> in my life.
I just have two <unk>.
This first, was more like a <unk> <unk>.
It was a <unk> fish, <unk>, good <unk>, <unk>, a <unk> on the <unk>.
What a fish.
Even better, he was <unk> in <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
So, you could feel <unk> it.
I had a <unk> with this beauty of a relationship over several months.
One day, the <unk> of the company and asked if I could <unk> at a <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
"Of course, I said.
Here was a company that was trying to solve what this <unk> has been <unk> problem for our <unk>, and how do we <unk> fish on our <unk>?
In the last 50 years, we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>.
It's hard to <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> percent of the big <unk>, which we love, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, they are <unk>.
It's almost nothing more <unk>.
So I think or <unk> <unk>, <unk>, a part of our future.
A lot of <unk> on it. <unk> the environment, most of them <unk>, and they are <unk>, we take <unk>. A big <unk>.
He's got a <unk> of 15 to one.
That is, 15 <unk> <unk> is needed to get a <unk> <unk>.
Not very <unk>.
It's not very good.
So here was finally a company that tried to make it right.
I wanted to <unk> them.
<unk> before the <unk>, I <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the company.
Let's <unk> it.
"<unk>," I said, "Just to have the <unk> right, you <unk> it, so far outside in the sea, that it doesn't <unk> it."
"This is true," he said. "We're so far outside that the <unk> of our fish is <unk>, not <unk>."
And then he <unk>, "We're basically a <unk> world.
This <unk> of <unk> to <unk> <unk>, "he said.
"The best in the <unk>."
<unk> to one, great.
"<unk> to one? What do you <unk>?"
"<unk> <unk>," he said.
"<unk>," I said, "<unk>.
And that night I was in bed, and I thought, what's a <unk> <unk> <unk>?
So I <unk> the next day, just before the <unk>, <unk>.
I said, "<unk>," <unk>, what are <unk> <unk>? "
He said he didn't <unk>. He won't <unk>.
Well, I <unk> with a few people in the company, and nobody could give me a <unk> answer, until I finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk>.
Let's <unk> it as well.
"<unk>," I said, "What are <unk> <unk>?"
Now, he <unk> some <unk> and some <unk>, and then he said, <unk>.
I said, "<unk>?"
He said, "Yeah, <unk>, skin, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
I said, "How much <unk> <unk> is <unk>?"
<unk> of maybe two percent.
"Well, that's about 30 percent," he said.
I said, "<unk>, what is <unk> about <unk>?"
There was a long <unk> in the <unk>, and he said, "There is just too much <unk> in the world."
I <unk> about this fish.
No, not because I'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
I'm even.
No, I actually <unk> from this fish, because, I'm <unk> in God, who has fish after this <unk> <unk>.
This second fish, this is a different kind of <unk>.
It's the <unk> way, the way you know, the way you know, ever <unk> better you know the fish, you're <unk> the fish <unk>.
I first <unk> it in a <unk> in <unk>.
A <unk> <unk> had been talking about this fish.
It has <unk> us.
He <unk> on the table with a <unk>, almost <unk> color.
The <unk> had <unk> him.
<unk> <unk>.
<unk>, he was still <unk>.
Who can <unk> a fish so well after it was <unk>?
I can't, but this guy can.
Let's <unk> it. In fact, it's called <unk>.
And no, he didn't <unk> the fish, and he's not <unk>. <unk> in the way that you and I <unk>.
He's a <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is a <unk> in the <unk> corner.
It's close to the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> to the <unk> was the <unk> in the hands of <unk>.
They were <unk> on what they were basically <unk>.
They did this by <unk> the country.
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk>, and they <unk> water out of the land and out in the river.
Well, they couldn't <unk> that the <unk>, not <unk>.
And <unk>, it was a <unk>.
It took about 90 percent of the <unk>, which is a lot of <unk> for this place.
And so, <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk> the country.
What did they do?
They've <unk> the river of the <unk>.
They literally <unk> the <unk>.
<unk> the water <unk>, they <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the water
They <unk> the <unk>.
They <unk> a <unk> <unk> -- <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> -- and <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, completely <unk>.
The <unk> is incredible.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
They <unk> out on the <unk>, which is a million miles away, and everything they're seeing is <unk> <unk> and these <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I didn't get <unk> at all the time.
He's a <unk> <unk>, three parts of the <unk> <unk> and part "A <unk> for <unk>."
Okay? We were <unk> and <unk> through the <unk> and I <unk> and <unk>, <unk> to my <unk> and <unk>, <unk> in <unk>.
Here he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, he mentioned the <unk> of <unk>.
And here, this is a pattern of <unk> <unk> that <unk> it <unk>.
It turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of his career in <unk> <unk> in Africa.
I asked him how he got to a <unk> <unk>.
He said, "<unk>? I know nothing about fish.
I'm a <unk> for relationships. "
And then he goes, and he <unk> into more <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And don't get me wrong, that was really <unk>, you know, the <unk> community, so in the <unk>.
It's great, but I was <unk>.
And my head was <unk> over this <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> that I had at the <unk>.
So I <unk> him. I said, "<unk>, how does it come up with <unk> fish so well?"
He showed up the <unk>.
"I know, boy, the <unk>, the <unk>, the relationships, that is incredible.
But what eat <unk> <unk>?
What is the <unk>? "
Now, he <unk> <unk> to tell me that it's such a <unk> system that the <unk> eat what they would eat.
The <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, which is what the <unk> <unk>.
The system is so healthy, it's <unk>.
There's no <unk>.
The more of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> their animals?
<unk> a day, I <unk> on this <unk>, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems to be," For a place that I've ever been, "How do you <unk>?"
In the moment, it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And we <unk> around the corner, and we <unk> the <unk> <unk>, thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk>, a literally <unk> <unk> so far the eye.
"That's success," he said.
"<unk> <unk> their <unk>, <unk>.
They <unk>. "
<unk>? I was completely <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, don't they <unk> fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the <unk>.
Now, last year, on this <unk> <unk> <unk>, more than <unk> different species.
It's been the largest largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> in Europe.
I said, "<unk>, is a good <unk> <unk> not the <unk> you want to have on a <unk> <unk>?"
He <unk> his head, no.
He said, "We're <unk>, not <unk>.
This is a <unk> network.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So the more <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>. "
Okay, let's <unk> it. A <unk> that don't <unk> their animals and a <unk> that <unk> their success in their <unk>.
A <unk>, but also a <unk>.
Oh, and <unk> should not be there.
They <unk> in a city <unk> miles away, where the <unk> is better for the <unk>.
<unk>, they fly <unk> miles to <unk>.
And every night they fly <unk> miles back.
They do that because they <unk> the <unk> line can follow the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>.
I had a kind of journey of <unk> <unk>, so I looked at <unk>.
I said, "<unk>, they fly <unk> miles to the <unk> and then they fly <unk> miles back on <unk>?
Are they going to <unk> that for kids? "
And he looked at me as I'd just <unk> a <unk> of <unk> <unk>.
He said, "No. They do that because the food is better."
And I didn't say my skin <unk> <unk>, the <unk> was, and I don't like a <unk>. I don't like them.
It's this <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
I <unk> almost never.
And yet, when I was in this <unk> in <unk> <unk>, they didn't <unk> at all.
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> as if you would take a <unk> of the ocean.
I <unk> this to <unk>, and he <unk>.
He said, "The skin <unk> like a <unk>.
It's the last <unk> before something in the body.
It has developed over the course of evolution to <unk> <unk>. "
And then he <unk>, "But our water has no <unk>."
Okay. A <unk> that doesn't <unk> their <unk>.
And then I realized when he says, a <unk> that doesn't have a <unk>, he <unk>, because the water that <unk> through this <unk> <unk> comes from the river <unk> <unk>.
It's a river that leads all the things that leads to the <unk> of the <unk> today to <unk> them with each other, <unk>, <unk> of <unk>.
And when it comes through the system, and this <unk> is the water as it is <unk>.
The system is so healthy, it <unk> the water.
So not only one <unk> that they don't <unk> their animals, not just a <unk> that is <unk> their success at the health of their <unk>, but a <unk> that's literally a <unk>, and not just for that <unk>, but for <unk>.
Because when the water is <unk>, it <unk>.
A <unk> in the ocean, I know, but I <unk> it, and you should do, because these <unk>, <unk>, as <unk> always, is <unk>.
You might say that they are a <unk> for the future of whether we're talking about <unk> or <unk>.
What we need now is a <unk> new concept of agriculture, from one, in the <unk> actually well well.
But for many people, it's a little bit <unk>.
We're not <unk>, we <unk>. We're <unk>.
We love <unk>. We love little <unk>. We're talking about <unk> <unk>. We're <unk>.
And if you think that are the things that are the future of good <unk>, someone on the future is to <unk> someone in and says, "Hey, I love <unk> <unk>, but how do you <unk> the world?
How are you going to <unk> the world? "
<unk> I be honest?
I don't like this question.
No, not because we're <unk> enough to produce the world more than just <unk>.
One billion people will <unk> today.
One billion -- this is more than ever before -- because <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk>, not the <unk>.
Now, I don't like this question because it has the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> for the last 50 years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> to <unk>, <unk> to the Earth, <unk> to <unk>, and all the time, just asked the <unk>, "If we <unk> more people, how <unk> can it be?"
It was the <unk>. It was the <unk>. It was the <unk> of American
We should call them what she is, a <unk> in <unk>, a <unk> <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
This is not a <unk>, and it's not agriculture.
Our <unk> today is <unk>, not because of <unk> <unk>, but because of <unk> resources.
Not by <unk> <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> land, not by <unk>, but by <unk> water, not through <unk>, but by <unk> water, not through <unk> and <unk>, but by <unk> in the ocean.
You want to <unk> the world?
Let's start with the question: How do we <unk> ourselves?
Or better, how can we create conditions that every community to <unk> themselves?
And to do that, don't look at the <unk> for the future.
It's really old, and it's <unk>.
<unk>, <unk> and machines are <unk> in it, and they never <unk> something really good for food.
Let's look at the <unk> model.
This is the one that <unk> on two billion years.
Look at <unk>, <unk> like <unk>.
<unk> that aren't <unk> for themselves, <unk>, the <unk> instead of <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> instead of just <unk>, <unk> that are not just <unk>, but <unk> for relationships.
Because they are the ones that are <unk> for <unk>.
And if I'm really honest, they're a <unk> <unk> than I will ever be.
You know, that's right, because if that's the future is the good, it will be <unk>.
Thank you.
I grew up with a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
In my <unk>, I <unk> with the <unk> to school, every day a <unk>.
And my <unk> <unk> always in a book, a <unk> that <unk> my mind in other <unk>, and in some ways my <unk>, <unk> <unk>.
This <unk> also showed that I always, if I wasn't in school, through the <unk> <unk>, <unk> and "<unk>," <unk>, "<unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>, and <unk>
I was <unk>, you know.
It was always about trying to understand the world and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
And my love to <unk> <unk> in my <unk>, because in the <unk> <unk>, in the <unk> <unk>, we went to the moon and the <unk>.
<unk> <unk> came into our <unk> with his <unk> <unk> that <unk> us, where animals and places a world of <unk> that we could never have before.
And then I think it's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And I was an artist.
I could <unk>. I could <unk>.
And because there was no <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> in the <unk>, I had to create the pictures in my head.
We had to <unk> that, and when we <unk> kids, we took the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> them on the <unk> in our <unk>.
My response was <unk> and <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and all of that.
In <unk>, I was <unk> by the teacher, as I was <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk>.
The creativity had to somehow get out.
And something happened in this way. What was <unk> me to <unk> <unk> <unk>, the idea of a completely <unk> world here on Earth itself.
<unk>, I would never get a <unk> world with a <unk>, and it seemed quite <unk>.
But here was a world that I could actually <unk>, here on the Earth, and she was as <unk> and <unk> like all I had read these books and <unk> like all I had read these books.
So I decided when I was 15 to become <unk>.
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in <unk>, <unk> miles away from the next ocean.
<unk>, I didn't let me <unk>.
I <unk> my father, until he finally made a <unk> in <unk>, New York, <unk>, <unk>, right on the other side of the <unk> where we <unk>.
I made my <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in <unk>, New York.
But the ocean, a real ocean, I got two years later, when we went to <unk>.
<unk>, in the 40 years, the <unk> are <unk>, I have about <unk> hours under water. 500 hours of them in <unk>.
And I've learned that the world of <unk>, even in the <unk> <unk>, even in the <unk>, as we really <unk>.
The <unk> of nature knows no <unk>, all of the <unk> of our own, <unk> human <unk>
<unk> to the days, I <unk> <unk> for what I see on my <unk>.
And my love <unk> to the ocean, with <unk> <unk> like <unk> and ever.
And when I <unk> a <unk> <unk>, it was the <unk>.
It seemed the best way to <unk> my <unk>, to create stories, with my <unk>, to create images.
As a child, I <unk> <unk> and so.
So movies were the way, images and stories and stories. The <unk> together.
Of course, the stories I was <unk> from the <unk>, "<unk>," <unk>, "and" <unk>, "<unk>," and "<unk>."
<unk>, "I could <unk> my <unk> for the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk>.
So, my two <unk>.
<unk> happened in "<unk>," <unk>, "a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>, we had to create a kind of <unk> <unk>, <unk>, back.
And what was <unk> was the first <unk> <unk> that ever <unk> in a film.
The film was not making money, right now he <unk> his <unk> for his <unk>, but I <unk> a little <unk>: The audience all over the world was like <unk> by <unk>, who <unk>.
<unk> <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> technology and <unk> are not <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
So they saw a little <unk>.
And that I found <unk> <unk>.
And I thought, "<unk>, that has to be <unk> in the <unk>."
So we went to "<unk> 2,", my next film, much further.
<unk> with <unk>, we <unk> the guy from <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the success is <unk> all the way down the <unk> of this <unk>.
And it was <unk>. We had created a little <unk>, and the <unk> in the audience was the same. We've got a little bit more money.
From these two experiences, a whole new world, a whole new world, a whole new world of creativity.
So I <unk> a company, with my good friend <unk> <unk>, who was the best <unk> and <unk>, and <unk>, and she <unk> "<unk> <unk>."
The <unk> of this company was to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with digital <unk>.
And then we did that, and then we <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
But in the '<unk>, we <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> -- we actually <unk> the company -- to <unk>, to <unk>.
I had written this piece "<unk>" that <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in a very new <unk>, with <unk> human, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> should be <unk>. And the world should be <unk>.
But the <unk> <unk> <unk>. And people in my company told me that we don't yet we were able to do this.
So I <unk> that and made this other film about the big <unk>, which was <unk>.
<unk> <unk>, I have that as "<unk> and <unk> on a <unk>," <unk>, "<unk> <unk>.
But I was actually <unk> to the real <unk> of the <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, I made the film.
That's the truth. The <unk> didn't know that.
And I <unk> them by saying, "We <unk> to the <unk>. We <unk> the real <unk>.
We're going to show it in the <unk> of the <unk>.
That's <unk>. It's a good <unk> <unk> <unk>. "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk>.
But that goes back to that, again, that's what it can do is get a reality reality.
We actually <unk> six months later, a reality that I <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>, four miles under the surface of the <unk>, and I <unk> the real <unk> through a <unk> <unk>.
It wasn't a film, no <unk>, that was real.
So that really <unk> me.
And the <unk> were <unk>, and we had to build <unk> and <unk> and everything <unk>.
And I noticed how much this <unk>, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Well, they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>.
You <unk> into these <unk>, then you <unk> into this <unk>, <unk> environment where no hope on, where no hope on <unk> when you don't make it back yourself.
And I thought, "<unk>, that's as I was in a <unk>.
That's really cool. "
I was <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk>.
<unk> of the part that has <unk> and science to do, and it was all <unk>. It was <unk>, it was <unk>.
And there was a experience that couldn't give me a <unk>.
Because, you know, I was able to imagine an <unk> that we could then make a <unk> <unk>, but I couldn't imagine what I would see outside of the <unk>.
I've seen some of the <unk> <unk>, I've seen creatures in <unk>, and sometimes things that I've never seen before, and sometimes things that never had seen before, and for the science at the time when we saw them, they didn't find any words.
So that's <unk> me really, and I wanted more.
And then I met a little bit <unk> decision.
After the success of "<unk>," I said, "Okay, I want to <unk> my <unk> as a <unk> in <unk> ice, and I'm going to <unk> a <unk>."
And then we started <unk> these <unk>.
We <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> them with <unk>.
We went back to the <unk> of <unk>.
We took little robots that we had built, which was a <unk> <unk>.
Our <unk> was <unk>, and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, which never had been done before.
No one had ever <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>, and you didn't have any <unk> for that.
Well, I <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk>, in a <unk>, and I look at the <unk>, in a <unk>, and I see <unk> that <unk> has <unk> <unk> there.
And I <unk> with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk>.
And I actually <unk> it, but my consciousness is within the <unk>.
It felt like I was <unk> within the <unk> of <unk>.
This was the <unk> form of a <unk> that I've ever <unk>, because before I <unk> up a corner, and I always knew what in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, because I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, when we were <unk> the film.
And the <unk> was a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>.
So this was a <unk> experience.
It made me aware of this <unk> that you can use <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> your own consciousness into the <unk>, into the other form of existence.
It was really <unk> <unk>.
And maybe a little <unk> on what might happen in some <unk> <unk>, if you have <unk> to study something or in some way, in some way, in some ways that I can imagine as an <unk>.
After this <unk>, we started what we've seen at the bottom, really <unk>, for example, these <unk>, where we saw these incredibly <unk> animals. These are <unk> <unk>, but they're on <unk>.
They live with <unk>.
They don't exist in a <unk> <unk> system, as we do.
And this is what you see animals that are <unk> right next to a 500 degrees <unk>.
<unk>, and you can't imagine that they can survive there.
And at the same time I was also very <unk> for <unk>, which was the <unk> of my childhood <unk>.
And so I <unk> to the people who are interested in the <unk>, and they're <unk> with the <unk>, and they're <unk> in the <unk>, and they're going to <unk>, and they go to <unk>, and they're going to go to <unk> and <unk>, then <unk> to <unk> our <unk>.
That was <unk>.
But at the end of that, at the end, that I took <unk> into the <unk>.
I took them with and <unk> them to the world down there: <unk>, <unk>, people who are <unk> for this <unk> <unk>, and I took them to the <unk> to the <unk> so on. I took them to the <unk> <unk>, and test <unk> and test <unk>.
We <unk> <unk>, <unk>, but actually science, <unk>, <unk>.
So the <unk> of the <unk> between my existence as a child, and the <unk> in reality.
And over this course, I've learned a lot.
I've learned a lot about science, but I've learned about <unk>.
Now, you think, a <unk> must be able to lead, a <unk> <unk> <unk> or something like that.
But I don't <unk> a lot of <unk> before I <unk> this <unk>.
Because at some point, I had to tell me, "What do I do here?
What do I do that? "
These <unk> movies no money.
We're going to play the <unk>. From <unk> no <unk>.
All of the think I was between "<unk>" and "<unk>" and "<unk>" <unk> "and I <unk> on a <unk> <unk>.
I've all these movies, these <unk>, for a very small audience.
No <unk>, no <unk>, no money. What do you do?
You <unk> it to <unk> the challenge to <unk> the challenge, and the ocean is the <unk> environment, which is there. You're <unk> it to the <unk>, and because of the <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> <unk> when a small group of people.
Because we've done all this with just 10 to 12 people who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and sometimes we were two to three months of <unk>.
And in this community, you know, the most important thing is the <unk> that you have in front of each other, because you have a job that you can explain to <unk>.
If you look at land and says, "We had to do it, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, and the <unk>, the whole <unk>, the <unk>, the whole <unk>, the <unk>," and the <unk>, the human <unk>, if you're working on <unk>, "you can't explain this."
There's a connection, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
So when I <unk> to <unk> my next film "<unk>," <unk>, "I was trying to <unk> <unk> <unk>, which is that you have his team <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> really changed.
So I stood again with a little team on <unk> <unk>, and we <unk> "<unk>" with a new technology that wasn't there before.
<unk> <unk>.
A <unk> challenge.
And we were <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> years.
<unk> my way to make movies, completely.
There were people who, the <unk>, we would have these <unk> really good <unk> and on the planet.
For me, it was a <unk> way to do my job, the <unk> process that has <unk> in the <unk>.
So what can we <unk> from all of this?
What are we learned?
I believe in the first place, the <unk>.
It's the <unk> human <unk>.
Our <unk> is a power that can actually make a reality.
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> is more important than all of the world.
And to me, young <unk>, they say, "<unk> me a <unk>, how I can do something like that."
And I say, "Don't <unk> yourself.
It's <unk> for you. Don't get it to you, <unk> not against itself. <unk> <unk> <unk> on you. "
The <unk> <unk> has a <unk>, "<unk> is not <unk>."
But in art, and in the <unk> has to be a <unk> <unk>, because there's a <unk>.
No <unk>, the innovation of <unk>, the innovation was ever <unk> without risk.
You have to be ready to take these <unk>.
And that's the idea that I'd like to give you to the way, and <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, but fear is not. Thank you.
And if I want to <unk> you today is that the <unk> of the data that we're <unk>, bigger than the <unk> of their <unk> and instead of thinking of <unk> to think about how we can use information so that we can use as information as well that are <unk> and we see <unk> that the <unk> that would not be <unk>.
So, what we see here is a <unk> <unk> after <unk> <unk>.
The program that I <unk> here is a little experiment.
It's called <unk>, and what I can do with <unk> is I can do with a certain <unk>, say we're <unk>.
And immediately, I see a different pattern that <unk>.
And that's because in the <unk> are the people in the <unk>, and they're here at the <unk>.
We can <unk> a step further and see the data then <unk> the data and see that <unk> and cancer are <unk>, but not for everyone.
Now, if we <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, let's see 40 years or <unk>, we see that <unk> even the <unk> is about the people should be <unk>.
And who <unk> is this is particularly in men.
So you can see that the <unk> of information and data in this way very <unk> is <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And if we can do this for <unk> <unk>, why can't it be for <unk> itself?
So what we have here are the <unk> of every single "<unk>" that have been <unk>.
It's all over here. It's all online.
You can test it after my talk.
With <unk>, they can <unk> into a <unk>.
You can <unk> in a <unk> year.
You can <unk> directly to a certain <unk>.
Now, if I look at the <unk>, I see the <unk> that seem in this <unk> and the <unk>.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>, so I <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> show in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, if I just want to get a <unk> <unk>, I could think "OK, what if I want to do with the <unk> <unk>?"
So I go back and <unk> the <unk>.
Now I see <unk> <unk>.
And so you get an idea of that if you <unk> in this way, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, you don't just <unk> or <unk>.
You're doing something that is actually a little different.
It's a little bit <unk>, and we think it's changing the way that information can be used
So I want to <unk> this idea a little bit further with what's <unk> is a little crazy.
What we've done here is, we've taken every single <unk> and put them on a little <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> a short <unk> and a <unk> for the <unk> that it comes.
I just show you the <unk> 500 of the <unk> 500 of <unk> <unk>.
But even in this <unk>, we can do a lot of things.
<unk>, we get a sense of the issues that are on the <unk>.
So I'm going to choose 'government.
Well, after I <unk> 'government, I realized that the <unk> that the most <unk> <unk>, and most <unk> <unk> <unk>, "people of the year."
This is really important, because this is a <unk> that doesn't <unk> in a single <unk>.
It's just <unk> when you look at a step, and the <unk>.
<unk> on one certain of these <unk>, I can go into the <unk> <unk>, "People of the year" and all of you see together.
Now, if I <unk> all these people <unk> that are <unk>, and some are coming from the science, some <unk>, some <unk>, <unk> from the economy. Here's my <unk>. And one comes from the <unk>. Here's my <unk>.
And <unk> is also a TED <unk> <unk>.
So we can now <unk> and take a look at all of the TED <unk>.
You see, we're <unk> on the web, as if it's really a web, not just from side to side, but a lot of <unk>.
And so I'd like to show you what might be a little <unk>.
I'm just going to show you just New York <unk> <unk>
<unk>, these <unk> -- I don't want to call it a <unk>; it's not a <unk>, but you can look at <unk> -- and we bring these <unk> to every single <unk> like this.
So I can <unk> a step and <unk> directly to a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And so that's important because you can only do that by <unk> <unk> in this way, and all the <unk> in this way, all the <unk> in the same way.
So I can <unk> in my <unk> <unk> in a certain <unk>.
Here's the <unk> of the entire <unk> <unk> that I have <unk> <unk>.
And I can do everything that I've seen today, again.
And when I <unk>, again, and on everything, I can <unk> my <unk> <unk> to <unk> my <unk>. Here, I <unk> <unk>, here, I went to <unk> '<unk>, here, or <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And from here I can <unk> and <unk> them again.
It's a <unk> that's used to <unk>, and every time it makes the <unk> bigger than the <unk> of the <unk>.
At the moment, in the world, we think that data is a <unk>.
We're talking about the <unk> of <unk>.
We're talking about <unk> in information.
What if we could <unk> this situation and <unk> the Internet on the head, so that instead of going to start to go from one other, to go from many things to many things and to see, and by by <unk>, what would be <unk> <unk>?
If we can do this, this <unk> <unk>, maybe a new source of information.
And instead of just <unk> in information, we can get knowledge of it.
And when we learn about knowledge, then we may even be <unk>.
So I <unk>, thank you very much.
<unk> <unk> today.
I've <unk> some people in the <unk> <unk> with "<unk>" in <unk> "in <unk>," in the last five years, and they <unk> up about 40, and there were much more.
There's a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of happiness.
There's a lot of <unk>.
<unk> would love to make people <unk>.
But despite all of this <unk> of work, there are several <unk> <unk> that are <unk> to be <unk>, <unk> to think about happiness.
And my talk today is <unk> by these <unk> <unk>.
It's true for <unk>, which are thinking about their own, and it's <unk> to think about happiness, because it's <unk> that we're just as <unk> as everyone else.
The first of this <unk> is a <unk>, complexity.
It turns out that the word is, it's just not a <unk> word, because we're <unk> to many different things.
I think there's a certain meaning in which we could <unk> it, but in the <unk> and <unk> is something that we need to be <unk>, and we're going to have to <unk> the <unk> of what is <unk>.
The second <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> and <unk>: <unk> she's <unk> between being happy in his life or happy with his life or happy with his life.
And these are two very different <unk>, and they're both <unk> in the notion of happiness.
And the third is the <unk>, and this is the <unk> fact that we can't think about a <unk> <unk>, the <unk> <unk> without <unk> its meaning.
I mean, this is a real <unk> <unk>.
There's just no way to get it right.
Now I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a <unk> after one of my <unk>, who was <unk> a story. [<unk>] He said he had heard a <unk>, and it was absolutely <unk> music, and at the end of the <unk>, there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
And then he <unk>, really quite <unk>, which has <unk> the whole experience.
But it didn't.
What it was <unk> was the <unk> of experience.
He had the experience.
He had had <unk> <unk> music.
They didn't <unk> because he was <unk> with a memory of the <unk>, and the memory was everything that he had to get to the <unk>.
What that really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self.
There is a <unk> self that <unk> in the <unk>, and the <unk> is to see the <unk>, but basically has the only <unk>.
It's the <unk> self, the doctor is <unk> -- you know when the doctor <unk> <unk>, "Is it now <unk> when I <unk> you?"
And then there's a <unk> self, and the <unk> self is the <unk> and the story of our lives, and it's <unk> that the doctor <unk> by <unk> the question, "How do you <unk> yourself in a long time?"
or, "How about your journey?" or something like that.
These are two very different <unk>, the <unk> self and <unk>, and the <unk> self, and that are too <unk> part of the <unk> of happiness.
Now, the <unk> self is a <unk>.
And the <unk> really with a <unk> response to our <unk> -- it <unk> immediately.
We don't just tell stories when we make ourselves stories.
Our <unk> <unk> tells us stories, which is what we're allowed to <unk> from our <unk> <unk> is a story.
And let's start with an example.
There's an old study.
These are real patients who <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I'm not going to go to <unk>. She's not <unk>, but she was <unk>, when she was done in the <unk>.
They were <unk> to <unk> all 60 seconds over their <unk>.
And here are two patients. These are their <unk>.
And you're asking, "Who of both of them?"
And this is a very simple question.
<unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk>. His <unk> was longer longer, and every minute of pain, the <unk> A had <unk> <unk>, and more.
But now there's another question: "How much did these patients thought that they were <unk>?"
And here's a <unk>.
And the <unk> is that <unk> A much <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The stories of the <unk> were <unk>, and because a very <unk> part of the story is how they <unk>.
And not that stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this <unk> -- but one of them is <unk> than the other.
And the ones that was the one where the pain was <unk> at the end on his <unk>. It's a <unk> story.
What do we know?
Because we've asked these guys for their <unk>, and also much later, "How <unk> was the whole thing?"
And she was much worse for A than <unk> in <unk>.
Now this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> self and the <unk> self.
From the <unk> of the <unk> self had a <unk> time.
Now, what you could do with <unk> A, and we actually did <unk> experiments, and it was done, and it's been done, and it's how you could actually <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> without <unk> to him.
It's going to lead that the <unk> <unk>, but just a little bit less than it.
And if you're doing a few minutes, you've <unk> that the <unk> self is <unk> from <unk> A <unk> <unk>, and you have <unk> that the <unk> self from <unk> A much better story, and now you have <unk> A better story about his experience.
<unk> a story?
And this is true of the stories that <unk> the <unk> of us, and it's also for the stories that we <unk>.
<unk> a story is <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk>.
<unk> are very, very important, and in this case, the end.
Now, the <unk> self lives.
It has <unk> of the <unk>, one after the other.
And you ask, what's going on with these <unk>?
And the answer is really simple. They're lost.
I mean, most <unk> of our lives -- and I have the <unk> -- you know, the <unk> <unk> <unk> than about three seconds. What you know is that in a life is about <unk> million of it. In a month, there's about <unk> million of them, and in a month there are about <unk>.
Most of them will be completely <unk> by <unk>.
And yet, you get the sense that they should <unk> that what's happening during this <unk> of the <unk> of our lives.
It's the <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> while we're in the world.
And as we would be important, but that's not the story that <unk> the <unk> self for us.
So we have the <unk> self and <unk> self, and they're really pretty <unk>.
The biggest difference between them is the <unk> of time.
From the <unk> self, if you have a <unk>, and the second week is just as good as the first, then the <unk> <unk> is <unk> as good as the <unk> <unk>.
This is not how it works for the <unk> self.
For the <unk> self, a <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> better than <unk>, because there's no new <unk> <unk>.
They didn't <unk> the story.
And in this way, time, is the <unk> <unk>, which is a <unk> self from a <unk> self.
Now, the <unk> self makes more than <unk> and to <unk> stories.
It's actually <unk>, because if you have a patient, because if you have a patient, who, we say, two <unk> <unk> on two different <unk>, and <unk> what it should be, then the <unk> of the <unk> that has <unk> the <unk> of <unk>, and that is <unk> to be <unk>.
The self has no voice in this choice.
In fact, we don't choose between <unk>.
And even when we think about the future, we think of our future is not as <unk>.
We think about our future as a <unk> <unk>.
And basically you can look at this, you know, as a <unk> of the <unk> self, and you can think of the self as one, as one, as one, as a, as a, as a <unk>, as an <unk>, a <unk> of the <unk> self.
I have the sense that if we <unk> are doing this very often, the case, which is, we make <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> self.
And that's a little bit hard to <unk>, I think.
I mean, how much <unk> we <unk> from our <unk>?
This is one of the <unk> that is <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> self.
And when I think about it, I think of a <unk> that we've been doing a few years ago in the <unk>, the best <unk> that I had ever had had had had, and I think, often <unk> to <unk> to how often I think about it.
And I've probably <unk> from my <unk> to this <unk> journey, I would say about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I ever had the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>, I would have spent another hour another hour.
Well, these are three weeks, and that's <unk> hours.
It seems to be a <unk>.
Well, I like to be a little extremely, you know, in the way that I have <unk> on the <unk> of <unk>, but even if you do more of that there is a real question. Why do we give <unk> so much <unk> in weight that we give you <unk>?
So I want you to think about a <unk>.
Imagine your next <unk>, you know that at the end of the <unk>, all of your <unk> are <unk>, and you get a <unk> <unk>, so you can't remember anything.
Now, would you choose the same <unk>? And if you would choose a different <unk>, there's a <unk> between your two types of self and you have to think about how you decide this <unk> and that's really not at all the time because if you're going to get a answer. And if you think you could think of one answer.
Why we <unk> the <unk> <unk> that we're <unk> a problem with a choice between the two species of self.
Well, the two types of self <unk>.
There are actually two <unk> of happiness that we can apply, one of self.
So you can ask, how happy is the <unk> self?
And then would you ask, how happy are the <unk> in life of the <unk> self?
And they're all -- happiness for <unk> is a pretty <unk> process.
<unk> are the emotions that can be <unk>?
And, <unk>, we're now <unk> a pretty good idea to get from happiness of the <unk> self.
If you ask happiness of the <unk> self, it's a very different thing.
It's not about how happy one person lives.
It's about how <unk> or <unk> the person is, when this person is <unk> about their lives.
It's a <unk> <unk>.
<unk> that <unk> don't <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>, and I <unk> to a lot of <unk> about <unk> that have long <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> have long <unk> on the <unk>.
The <unk> between happiness of the <unk> self and the <unk> of the <unk> self has been <unk> in the last few years, and now you're <unk> to measure the two <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> has a <unk> <unk>, where more than a <unk> million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their <unk>, and there were other <unk> in the direction.
So in the last few years, we've started to learn about happiness of the two species of self.
And the <unk> <unk> that we, I think, is that they're really <unk>.
You can know how <unk> someone is with his life, and they really don't care about how happy he lives and <unk>.
Just just to give you a sense of the <unk>, the <unk> is about <unk>.
What that means is that if you were to meet someone, and you would tell you, his dad is a <unk>, how much would you know about its size?
Now, you would know something about its size, but there's a lot of <unk>.
They have so much <unk>.
If I tell you that someone has its life as eight on a <unk> of 10 <unk>, you have a lot of <unk> about how happy it is it with his <unk> self.
So the <unk> is <unk>.
We know something about what <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>.
We know that money is very important, <unk> are very important.
We know that happiness is <unk> to be <unk> with people that we like.
There are other <unk>, but this is <unk>.
So if you're lucky to <unk> the two types of self, you're going to be very different things.
The <unk> of what I've said here is that we should be lucky, that we should not be <unk> as a <unk> for <unk>.
It's a completely different term.
Now, very short, another reason that we can't think about happiness is that we can't think about happiness is that we don't <unk> on the same things that we think about life, and if we actually live.
So if you ask the simple question, how happy people are in California, you don't get the <unk> answer.
If you ask this question, you think that people have to be <unk> in California, if you say, in <unk>.
And what's happening is that when you think about life in California, you think about the difference between California and other places, and this is what we say, in the <unk>.
Well, it turns out that <unk> is not very important for the <unk> self, and it's not even very important to the <unk> self, and it's not even very important for the <unk> self, the <unk>, how happy people are.
Now, because the <unk> self is responsible, you can <unk> at the end -- some people might be <unk> at the end -- some people might go to California.
And it's interesting to be that, to say, "What's happening with people that California, to become <unk>.
Now, their <unk> self isn't going to be <unk>.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen. They will think they're <unk>, because when they're going to be <unk> about how <unk> the <unk> was in <unk>, and they're going to be <unk>, and they're going to be <unk> the right decision.
It's very hard to think about <unk>, and I hope, I have a sense of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris <unk>: Thank you. I have a question for you.
Thank you.
Now, when we <unk> <unk> a couple of weeks ago, <unk> you to me that there was a pretty <unk> result that came from this <unk>.
Is that something that you can let us <unk> you, because now you have a few minutes <unk>?
<unk> <unk>: <unk>.
<unk>, the <unk> thing that we've found in the <unk> <unk> <unk> is a number that we didn't expect.
We found that in <unk> to the happiness of the <unk> self.
If we look at how feelings with the income is <unk>.
And it turns out that under a income of <unk> dollars a year, for Americans, and that's a very large <unk> of <unk>, about <unk>, but it's a big <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>, but it's a big <unk> <unk>, under a year.
CA: <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>.
<unk> dollars a year, people are <unk>, and they're <unk> <unk>, and they are <unk>, ever <unk> them.
<unk>, we get an absolutely <unk> line.
I mean, I've seen so <unk> <unk>.
What happens, obviously is that money doesn't make a <unk> <unk>, but that <unk> money on a certainly <unk> <unk>, and we can do this <unk> very, very <unk>.
In the sense of self, the <unk> self, you get a different story.
The more money you're <unk>, the more money you are.
It's not true of emotions.
CA: But <unk>, in the entire American <unk> is about life, freedom to <unk>.
If people would take this <unk> seriously, I mean, it seems to put it all on the head, everything that we think, for example, in terms of <unk> and so on.
Is it a chance that <unk> would take a <unk> that the country would take a <unk> <unk> <unk> like the seriously and <unk> about it?
<unk>: You know, I think there are <unk> for the role of <unk> in politics.
The <unk> is going to be slowly in the United States, no question, but in the United States, it's happening in other countries.
People are <unk> that they should think of happiness when they're thinking about politics.
It's going to be a <unk> <unk>, and people are <unk> whether they want to study <unk> or whether they want to study <unk>, so we need to <unk> these <unk> pretty soon.
As you think about how much <unk> are <unk> of how you think and whether you think about about the <unk> self.
It's going to affect, I think in the <unk> years.
In the United States, you <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population.
That will, I think, in the next next one or two <unk> part of the <unk>.
CA: Well, it seems to me, this issue is going to be the <unk> of political <unk> for the next few years.
Thank you for the invention of <unk>.
Thank you, <unk> <unk>.
Today, I'm talking to you about energy and <unk>.
And that might be surprised because my <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the things that we need to <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> two billion lives.
But energy and <unk> are extremely important for those people, in fact, more important than any other on the planet.
<unk> means that their <unk> are not going to grow over many years, and we're going to be <unk> to a little bit, and the things are going to change the way it can't be <unk>.
It leads to <unk>. It <unk> to <unk>.
So, a <unk> <unk> will be <unk> for them.
<unk>, the <unk> is very important for them.
The fact is that if you could <unk> only one thing to <unk> the price of <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Well, the <unk> is over time.
In fact, the <unk> is based on <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> revolution and even in the 20th century, there was a <unk> case in the <unk>, and so we have <unk>, <unk>, we can make <unk> materials and so many things.
So we're in a <unk> situation with electricity in the <unk> world.
But when we <unk> the price -- let's <unk> -- we <unk> the price -- we <unk> to a new <unk>, and this <unk> <unk> with <unk>.
<unk> <unk> the planet, and the <unk> for <unk> is actually quite clear.
They <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk>, and they have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, and maybe a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>, and maybe the <unk> that the natural <unk> that the natural <unk> can't be <unk>, and so so it has a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk>.
Now, the most <unk> relationship between a <unk> and that <unk> by <unk> and where the other <unk> are, there, there are some <unk>, but not very many.
And there's safe <unk> about how <unk> these <unk> are, but they will be extremely <unk>.
I <unk> the <unk> <unk>, "<unk> we really get down close to <unk>?
<unk> not half or a <unk>? "
And the answer is that we get close to <unk>, the <unk> is <unk> <unk>.
So it's a big challenge.
It's very different than to say, we have a <unk> <unk> high <unk>, which has to <unk> under a <unk> <unk>.
This is going to have to go down on <unk>.
Well, we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>, over <unk> billion <unk>.
<unk> Americans are about 20 <unk>. People from <unk> countries, less than one.
In the <unk>, it's about five <unk> for everyone on the planet.
And in some way, we need to <unk> changes that.
It's <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> different <unk> have it <unk> to <unk>, and we have to go from <unk> <unk> and to a <unk> <unk> to <unk>.
This <unk> has four <unk>. A little bit of <unk>. They have this thing on the left -- <unk> that you want to <unk>, and that's going to be <unk> by the number of people who are using the <unk> that every person who is using the <unk> that every person is <unk> to <unk> a <unk>.
So let's look at every <unk>, and we <unk> how we get that on <unk>.
<unk>, one of these numbers has to be very <unk> of <unk>.
Now this is <unk> <unk>, but we go through it.
First, we have the population.
Today, <unk> billion people live.
And it's <unk> to <unk> billion <unk>, which is <unk> on <unk> billion.
If we're very successful with new <unk>, the <unk> and <unk>, we might be able to <unk> for 10 percent to 15 percent, but at the time, we see a <unk> <unk> around <unk>.
The second <unk> are the <unk> that we use.
The <unk> everything that we eat, <unk>, television, <unk>.
These are very good things and <unk> means to make that <unk> almost everyone on the planet.
It's great that this number is <unk>.
In the <unk> world, in the <unk> billion, we could make <unk> and use less, but in the <unk>, this number of <unk>, and so <unk> more than <unk>, which is <unk> the number of <unk> per year.
Here we see a very <unk> <unk>. <unk> it at home to light so that you can read the <unk>?
And these students don't have them, so they're going to read their <unk> under the <unk>.
Well, in <unk>, the <unk>, the energy per <unk>, there's finally good news.
We have something that doesn't <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk>, through other <unk>, through new <unk>, through new <unk>, through new <unk>, and there are lots of <unk> whose <unk> can be <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>: <unk> some <unk>, <unk> <unk> by 90 percent.
Some of them <unk> by 90 percent.
In other <unk>, like the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> <unk>: <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> or <unk>, the <unk> <unk> is much smaller.
<unk>, if we're <unk>, we might get a <unk> <unk> <unk>, or maybe even <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk>.
But at the first three <unk>, we are now <unk> by <unk> billion <unk> on maybe <unk> billion <unk> billion <unk>, and that's just not.
So let's look at the <unk> <unk> -- and this is going to be a <unk> -- which is the amount of carbon that's <unk> per <unk>.
It <unk> the question of whether you can get that on <unk>.
If you <unk> <unk>: No.
If you <unk> <unk>: No.
<unk> every <unk> for <unk> power <unk>, except the <unk> and <unk>.
So what we need to do on a global <unk> is to create a new system.
We need <unk>.
Now, if I <unk> the term "<unk>," I don't mean the <unk>.
The <unk> is a <unk>. The <unk> is a <unk>.
The Internet and its <unk> is a <unk>.
The people here have <unk> to the <unk> of this <unk>.
<unk>, there's no <unk> that you need a <unk> to a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, you're just <unk>, and some people are coming, they don't.
In this case, we have to give <unk>, and there's a <unk> in very <unk> time.
Well, I asked, how can I really <unk> that?
Is it a natural <unk>, a <unk> that <unk> the idea of people here?
And I was <unk> last year, when I <unk> <unk>, and somehow <unk> people.
The idea became really <unk> for them, you know there are people who live with <unk>.
It <unk> for energy here.
I decided that the <unk> of <unk> my <unk> would be here.
So here are some natural <unk>.
You've <unk> to me that they don't <unk>, and in fact, they're not even
Well, there are all kinds of <unk> like this, but they don't get much.
We need solutions, either one or the number of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>, and even though there's a lot of <unk>, where people are looking for for <unk>, I see only five that can afford these big <unk>.
I <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>.
These may be <unk>, and if they're going to afford <unk> than I <unk>, that would be great, but my <unk> here is that we need to work on all the <unk>, and we can't <unk> of them because they all have <unk> <unk>, because they all have <unk> <unk> problems.
Let's look at the first <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> of either <unk> or <unk>.
What you need to do, maybe it's easy, but it's not. You have to get all the <unk> that after the <unk> comes out of the <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and hope that it <unk> there.
There are some <unk> that are <unk> on a 60 percent -- 80 percent <unk>, but it's going to be very difficult, and it will be very difficult, and a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk>, is a big challenge. But the biggest problem here is the <unk>.
Who will <unk> it?
Who can <unk> something that literally a lot bigger than any kind of <unk> that you can imagine <unk> and other things?
This is a lot of <unk>.
So this is a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: <unk>.
It also has three big problems. The cost, especially in <unk> countries. The question are high, and the question for security, you really feel that can't go <unk>, despite the human <unk> that the <unk> is not being used for weapons.
And what do you do with the <unk>?
Because even though it's not very big, there's a lot of <unk>.
People have to feel good. <unk> <unk>: 10: 10: <unk>, <unk> -- 10: <unk>: <unk>, so <unk> three very <unk> problems that might be <unk>.
So three very <unk> problems that might be <unk>, and that's why you should work on.
The last three of the five I've <unk>.
It's the <unk> <unk>, how often they're called <unk>.
And they also have -- although it's great that they don't need a <unk> -- they have some <unk>.
One is the <unk> that <unk> these technologies <unk> <unk> than the <unk> of <unk>.
These are <unk>, they're talking about many <unk>, <unk> more <unk> than a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>, this <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> doesn't seem all day, it doesn't seem <unk> every day, and it's not constantly.
And so you have to be <unk> by these <unk>, when you're not <unk>, you have a way to get energy in times when you don't <unk>, you're <unk>.
So there's a big <unk>. There's challenges in the <unk>, and when we say that the <unk> is outside of the country, you need to deal with the risk of <unk>, you need to deal with the risk that the energy from where it is <unk>.
And there's the <unk>.
And to show the <unk>, I have all kinds of <unk> that are made, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, for cars, <unk>, <unk>, for everything. And that I've got with the amount of energy that <unk> the world, <unk>. I found that all the <unk> that we're <unk>, and I found that all the <unk> that we're <unk>, and I found that all the <unk> that we could make the <unk> that we're <unk> now,
So, we need a big <unk>, something that's going to be a <unk> 100 <unk> than the <unk>.
It's not possible, but it's not so easy.
That happens when you're trying to <unk> this <unk> <unk> about, we say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk>.
If you want to <unk> 100 percent, you need an incredible <unk>.
Well, where are we going, what is the right approach?
A <unk> project? How do we get to
What we need is many companies that are working on it.
In each of these five <unk>, we need at least 100 people.
And so many of you will say, they're crazy! That's good.
I think there's a lot in the TED group, there are many that are already <unk> there.
Bill <unk> has several companies, there's a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> companies in <unk> companies make the great things, and I'm trying to support that.
<unk> <unk>, and I <unk> a company, maybe <unk>, the <unk> approach.
There are some <unk> in the <unk>; <unk>, <unk>.
The development has <unk> in this industry from a few time, so it's not a big <unk> that some good <unk>.
The <unk> means that you <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the <unk>, which is, we decided to <unk> the <unk> percent, we decided to <unk> the <unk>
It's a pretty <unk> idea.
But, in fact, you had a long time, but you could never <unk> whether it would work, but there's <unk> <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> it and see that, yes, there's <unk>.
And because you <unk> these <unk> percent, the <unk> is much better.
In fact, you're <unk>, and you can actually use the <unk> of <unk> today's <unk> as <unk>.
It just <unk> the head of <unk>, <unk> it just. A great thing.
The <unk> is <unk> <unk>, a little bit like a <unk>.
You see that it's a kind of <unk>, often as "<unk> <unk> <unk>."
The <unk> really <unk> that.
Here's a picture of a <unk> in <unk>.
This is the <unk> that <unk> percent. You have the part that's <unk> today, so it's called <unk> <unk> <unk>.
The <unk> <unk> for hundreds of years.
And when you're <unk> <unk> and you just get <unk>, you get <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of the planet.
You know, there's a lot of challenges, but there's an example of many <unk> of <unk> that we need to get <unk>.
Let's measure how we should measure our success.
What should be our <unk> look like?
Now, we go to the goal that we need to get to it, and then we talk about the <unk>.
A lot about a 80 percent <unk> to <unk>.
It's really important that we get there.
The <unk> 20 percent will be <unk> in <unk> countries, and still something else, and <unk> is going to be <unk>, and <unk> will be <unk> to be <unk> to <unk>.
So, to get these 80 percent, the <unk> <unk>, <unk> countries like China, their <unk> completely <unk>.
The other <unk> says if we're using the <unk> technology, whether they were in all developed countries, and we are on the way to get them to the rest.
This is <unk> important.
This is going to be a <unk> <unk>.
If we <unk> from there, what should be <unk> <unk>?
It should <unk> the two elements.
We should use the <unk> to bring <unk> to the <unk>, and the less we need, the more <unk>, the <unk> will be the <unk> and the <unk>.
But in fact, this <unk> is the things that we <unk> that are not completely <unk> to the big <unk>, just the same, or even <unk> as important as the other, which <unk> the <unk> of innovation for this <unk>.
We need to <unk> with <unk>, and we can measure this: in <unk>, in <unk> and <unk>.
There are lots of great books to this issue.
The <unk> <unk> book, "We have the <unk>" and David <unk> "<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>."
They really go through and create a <unk> where this can be <unk> <unk>, because we need support for the <unk> of all pages.
There's <unk> that has to <unk>.
This is a wish.
It's a very <unk> wish that we <unk> technology.
If you just <unk> me a wish for the next 50 years, I could <unk> the <unk>, a <unk>, and that I love, or I could choose this wish, which is, <unk> <unk> without <unk> that <unk>, I <unk>.
This has the largest <unk> <unk>.
If we don't <unk> that wish, the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> people are <unk>, between the <unk> and China, between <unk> and <unk> and almost all of the lives of the <unk> and almost all of the lives of the two billion and almost all of the lives of these two billion will.
So what do we need to do?
What <unk> I do?
We need to use more <unk>.
If countries like <unk>, in places like <unk>, they should not just talk about <unk>.
You should be <unk> this <unk>, and you would be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk>, which are <unk> for these <unk> <unk>.
We need <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, something that makes a <unk> <unk>.
We need to <unk> the message.
We need to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the things that are <unk> by the government.
It's an important wish, but I think we can <unk> it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris <unk>: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Just to understand something -- <unk>, <unk>, can you give us an idea of the <unk> of this <unk>?
Bill <unk>: In order to get the <unk> on a <unk> <unk>, all big scientists, which we need just 10 million, and even when we <unk> our materials in a <unk> <unk> to make sure that it works is <unk>, you just in the <unk> million.
The <unk> step is the <unk> of the first <unk> <unk> to find another billion, the <unk> and the place that was actually <unk> the first of it.
<unk> of the <unk> is done when it's <unk> like <unk>, then it's all right, because the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> is so different from <unk>, how we know them.
CA: So to understand this really: that means deep in the ground, almost like a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>, this <unk> <unk>, and then the process starts to <unk> the <unk>, and then works on the bottom?
<unk>: Right. Today, you have to <unk> the <unk>, so there are lots of people and lots of <unk> that can go. This thing where you <unk> it and <unk> or <unk>. It's not good.
But if you have very <unk> <unk>, you can <unk> it for 60 years -- think of a <unk> -- think about a <unk> -- that you <unk> without all the <unk>.
And it's sitting there and <unk> 60 years, and then it's finished.
CA: A <unk>, which <unk> itself <unk> a solution for the <unk>.
<unk>: Yeah. Well, what's going on with the <unk>, you can <unk> it -- there's a lot less <unk> with this <unk> -- then you take it and <unk> it in the next <unk> and <unk> it.
And we start by by taking the <unk> that exists in this <unk> or <unk> in the <unk>, and that's what's our <unk>.
So, what was a problem for this <unk> was a problem, what we <unk> in our <unk> and it's going to be the <unk> <unk> during this <unk>.
CA: But while you're talking about different people in the world about these possibilities.
where is the largest interest, so what really <unk>?
<unk>: Well, we haven't <unk> in a place, and there's a lot of <unk> <unk> for everything that "<unk>" <unk> "in the name. There's big interest and the people of the <unk> in <unk>, India, China... I was here and talked about how this to <unk>.
I'm <unk>. You know, the <unk> and <unk> have something in the direction.
This is a <unk> of one thing that was done.
This is a <unk> step, but it's like a faster <unk>, and some countries have built these, so everybody who has a <unk> <unk> <unk>, a <unk> for our first.
CA: In your mind, <unk>, <unk> and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> that's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> that?
<unk>: Well, we need one of these <unk>, <unk> things that are very <unk>, we have 20 years to <unk>, and then 20 years to <unk>.
This is the <unk> that has <unk> us the <unk> that we need to <unk>.
And, you know, <unk>, if everything's going well, and that's a big wish, that could be easy.
And <unk>, there are <unk> of companies today, and we need <unk>, which, as if their <unk> work, the <unk> for their <unk>, can <unk> for their <unk>, can <unk> for it.
And it would be <unk> when you create several, because then you could use a <unk>.
<unk>, we need a solution.
CA: <unk> of the great <unk>, is this <unk> that you know?
<unk>: A <unk> is <unk>.
It would be without the <unk>, but it does it even more important.
In <unk>, there are other <unk> companies.
You know, we don't know their work as well as this, but there is the <unk> <unk>, which is a different approach.
There's a <unk> <unk>, which seems to be a little bit difficult, but maybe that's a little bit of us.
And so there are different, but the nice thing about it is that a <unk> <unk> has a million times so much energy as a, and so if you can deal with the problems, and so if you can deal with the issues, and the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> on the country.
CA: If that doesn't <unk>, what?
Are we <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> <unk>?
<unk>: If you go into this situation, it's as if you have too much <unk>, and <unk> before a <unk>. What do you do? You might need a <unk> or <unk>.
There's a <unk> called <unk> <unk>, which is <unk> with different <unk> to <unk> the <unk> so that we <unk> 20 or 30 years, to <unk> to <unk> us.
This is just a <unk>.
You know, we don't need that.
Some people say, you don't have to work on the <unk> because it might be <unk> so that you're going to <unk>, because you know that you will save the <unk>.
I don't know if it's <unk>, if you look at the <unk> of this <unk> eyes, but there's now a <unk> in <unk> about whether you should have that, if you should have that, if you need to be able to get things faster, or this innovation.
CA: <unk>: Have you one or two <unk> for the one or two <unk> to <unk> you?
<unk>: Well, unfortunately, unfortunately, the <unk> in very different <unk>.
<unk>, the scientific <unk> are very little.
<unk> they realized that there are <unk> that there are <unk> to do with the <unk> that <unk>?
There are very, very few things that they can tell, which is a chance in a million.
This <unk> here is the same as <unk>.
You're doing the <unk> now, and you're <unk> a lot later.
And so the idea is, now, if you have all kinds of <unk> problems, in something that you have just <unk> what -- and it's not so clear. In fact, the <unk> <unk> is not necessarily <unk> the <unk> <unk>, and there are people in the world that look at <unk> and say, okay, that's not a big <unk>.
The fact is that this <unk> should be worried.
But my dream here is that if you can make it <unk>, and at the same time <unk>, then <unk> say the <unk>, "Okay, it doesn't matter <unk>, I'm going to be <unk>, but I'll be <unk> because it's <unk> as the <unk>."
CA: And that would be your answer to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that if you all of that time and energy to solve all the other <unk> <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk>, the <unk> of <unk> and so on that it's a <unk> <unk> of resources to <unk> and so on that it's a <unk> <unk> of resources to <unk>.
<unk>: Well, the <unk> <unk> for research -- say we should be the <unk> 10 billion per year more than they do now -- that's not so <unk>.
<unk> should not be <unk>.
You then get too big <unk>, and you can <unk> people <unk> when you have something that isn't <unk>, and it's trying to <unk> that.
It's because you're a little <unk> before a <unk>, and it's just the <unk>, and I think we should try to do more things that have the <unk> to be much <unk>.
If the <unk> that you get, you're a very <unk> <unk>, then you can only <unk> the <unk>.
I mean, every one of us might be five times as much for our energy without <unk>.
It's a <unk> for two billion, but it's a <unk>.
And even <unk> think about it.
His new <unk> is now, "Why is the research is not going to <unk>?"
He's still going to be a <unk>, because of his <unk> stories, but it's got to understand that this is a very <unk> group, and so it's going to <unk> the <unk>.
And this is a <unk> that I think is <unk>.
The research, it's just crazy, how little the <unk> is going to be.
CA: And Bill, I think I'm going to talk for almost all people here when I say, I really hope your wish. Thank you so much.
<unk>: Thank you.
I'd like to tell you something that I'd like to give you a few months ago, a <unk> <unk> <unk>.
I've always <unk> my <unk>, but I was <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> already, and I <unk> that I never <unk> in my life, which means that I never <unk> in my life, which means "<unk>" <unk>.
I <unk> you the <unk>.
"<unk>," <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>,
<unk>: <unk>, strong, <unk>. "
I <unk> this list of a friend <unk>, and I had to <unk> <unk> <unk>, but I just came to "<unk>" and not <unk> <unk>, and he had to <unk> <unk>, and I had to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk>.
Of course, this was a <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and I just thought that the <unk> has to be pretty old.
But in fact, a <unk> on the early <unk>, when I was <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and started to <unk> my <unk> outside of my <unk> <unk> and <unk>, also in terms of other children and to <unk> the <unk> world around me
And thank thank thank thank thank you very much.
<unk> I would be born in a world that I would be born into a world that somebody like me as a person would <unk> <unk> who can <unk> life in a <unk> way, but I'm going to <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> that I've <unk>.
So I immediately <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk>, and I expected to make a <unk> here.
Here's the <unk> version of this <unk>.
It's not much better.
<unk> <unk> me the last two words under "<unk>" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "
But it's not just about the words.
It's about what we think about the people that we describe with these <unk>.
It's about the values that in these words, and how we <unk> these values.
Our language <unk> our thinking, and how we see the world and the people around us.
A lot of <unk> societies, <unk> that the <unk> and the <unk>, have really <unk> that the <unk> of a <unk> <unk>, because what you can <unk>, what you can <unk>, too.
So, what do we're actually going to <unk> -- a <unk> people or a <unk> <unk>?
<unk> a human being <unk> as a child, could <unk>, could <unk> them and <unk> them.
<unk> 't it <unk> to open you?
One person who was <unk> for me, my <unk> was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
It's called Dr. <unk> <unk>. A <unk> whose name, as you can think most Americans couldn't <unk> <unk>, and so he was called Dr. <unk>.
And Dr. <unk> <unk> has always been very <unk>, and it was <unk> for children just like this.
I found the time that I've spent in this hospital, just great -- until my <unk>.
I had to <unk> single <unk> <unk> <unk> with these <unk>, <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know, to <unk> my <unk>, and I've <unk> these <unk> more than anything else. I <unk> them. I <unk> them.
And imagine, I've even <unk> as a <unk> child with Dr. <unk> <unk>, and so <unk> to <unk> that <unk> without success.
And one day, he <unk> me on one of my <unk> -- these <unk> were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me, "<unk>, <unk>, you're a <unk>, <unk> girl, you're a <unk>, <unk> girl, and <unk> girl, you're going to be one day.
And when you're <unk>, I give <unk> dollars. "
This was just a simple <unk> from Dr. <unk> <unk>, so that I didn't want to do with the <unk> that I didn't want to do with the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> girls in the <unk>, but he actually <unk> me to see my <unk> <unk> with new eyes, and he was actually <unk> me to see a new <unk> and <unk>.
And I wonder today, how much his vision of me as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> girl, and I could imagine myself as a <unk> of nature's <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and <unk>.
This is just one example of many, like <unk> in <unk> can <unk> the <unk> of a <unk>.
But as the <unk> <unk> examples from the <unk> of <unk>, <unk> our language no space to <unk> something that we would all be <unk>: it <unk> to <unk> each other to see themselves as <unk> people.
Our language is <unk> the <unk> that were <unk> in many cases through a <unk> change in many cases.
<unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk>, you can say that my legs, the <unk> for <unk>, <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> bodies that allow people to really <unk> to use all of their possibilities and <unk> that they <unk> their <unk>, and they <unk> about the <unk> that their <unk> to <unk> them, not to be able to be able to <unk> on their own <unk>, not to be able to be able to <unk>,
And so in the world are <unk> to groups that <unk> them themselves.
So maybe <unk> of this <unk> change, because the <unk> has always been a different truth, which is that every person of society can be a very <unk> and very <unk>, and that the human ability to <unk>, and that the human ability to <unk>,
The human ability to <unk> -- this is an interesting story, because people are <unk> me to tell you how I <unk> with <unk>, and I'm going to <unk> you something: that <unk> has never <unk> for me, and I always <unk> very <unk> to answer the questions of people to answer, and I think, <unk> why.
This <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> 's idea that success or happiness or happiness from <unk> a challenge, without being <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk>, and when my life was so successful, and when my life was so <unk> <unk>, because I could <unk> the possible <unk> of a life with a <unk> <unk>, or <unk> people with my <unk>.
But the truth is that we change. Of course we're <unk> by the challenge of the challenge, whether they're <unk>, <unk> or even <unk>.
And I realized that this is good.
<unk> are not a <unk> that we need to <unk> to get our lives better.
<unk> just to our lives.
And I tend to see <unk> as my <unk>.
Sometimes I <unk> that it's very <unk>, sometimes it's <unk> to see, but it's constantly with me.
And I want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of a human.
There are <unk> in life and challenges, and they're just <unk> <unk> and every person is about it, but the question is not whether we're <unk> with <unk> or not, but the question is how we get there.
So we're not just responsible for the people that we love to <unk> from <unk>, but they also <unk> to get good at it.
And we don't <unk> our children when we give them the feeling that they can't <unk>.
You have to <unk> two things: to be a medical fact, to be <unk>, and to the other people's <unk> about whether I'm <unk> or not.
And to be honest, the only <unk> and <unk> <unk> that I had to <unk> is that the world's constantly <unk>, is that the world <unk>, <unk> them with these <unk>.
In our desire to protect the people who are <unk> to protect us from the heart of the <unk>, <unk> truth about their medical <unk> or even a <unk> to <unk> that they're expected, we need to <unk> that we don't <unk> the <unk> for <unk> that someone is actually <unk>.
Maybe the <unk> concept that's just <unk> what's in a <unk>, and how we <unk> the <unk>, for every single <unk> of a bigger <unk> than the <unk>.
If we don't treat a human beings, and not all its forces and possibilities and <unk>, we create <unk> to the natural <unk> that they may have to lead a different disease.
We <unk> a people who has a value for our society.
So we have to look at the <unk>, and we need to focus on all the human possibilities of possibilities.
But on the <unk>, there is between the <unk> of our <unk> and our <unk>, a connection.
We should not <unk> those <unk> times or <unk>, we should not <unk> to <unk> them, we should not try to <unk> them, but it's about <unk> in the <unk> <unk>.
It may be more <unk> to me that we don't necessarily have to <unk> <unk>, but that we're open to <unk> them to <unk> them on the <unk>, to <unk> them on the <unk> to <unk>, and maybe even <unk> with it.
And maybe we can do it as a little <unk>, <unk> and <unk> and feel <unk> and <unk> and feel <unk> and <unk> and feel like that.
In this year, we <unk> the 200, <unk> <unk> <unk>, and when he wrote about <unk> years ago, in my eyes, on something very <unk> in my eyes, on something very <unk> in the human <unk>.
I would <unk> it like this: Not the <unk> of its kind of <unk>, and not the <unk> of its species, but the one who can <unk> to change the best.
<unk> creativity.
Not just <unk> <unk>, we know that the ability to survive and <unk>, the <unk> of the human <unk> is <unk> to <unk> through <unk>.
So, <unk>, change and <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of the people.
And maybe we only know, from <unk> <unk> we're <unk> when we're really <unk>.
<unk> is exactly the point of <unk>, a <unk> of the <unk>, a sense of our own power.
We can <unk> ourselves.
We can <unk> a new meaning that is going to be <unk> about <unk> times.
Maybe we can see <unk> as change.
<unk>, for a change that we don't have any <unk>.
I think the largest <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> ourselves is to believe that we should be <unk>.
<unk>, who is <unk>?
There's no <unk>.
There's the <unk>. The <unk>. But not the <unk>. And would you really want to know this <unk>, <unk> person really want to learn if they really <unk>?
I think rather than that.
It would be great when we <unk> this <unk> of <unk> against a different <unk> or the <unk> to even <unk>, <unk>, could <unk> <unk>.
<unk> <unk> have found that we have people from the <unk> of our society, and to be a <unk>.
There are <unk> that already the <unk>, <unk> years ago, people with <unk> <unk> <unk>, and people with <unk> <unk> <unk>, and maybe that, because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people for society.
They didn't look at these people as <unk> and <unk>; they were <unk> as a <unk> and <unk>.
A few years ago, I was in the city where I was <unk>, in a <unk> in <unk>, "<unk> <unk>" in the <unk> of <unk>, and I stood there in front of a <unk> <unk>.
It was summer, and I had <unk>.
And I <unk>, like a guy behind me says, "Well, if that's not <unk> <unk>."
And I <unk> around and I see this <unk> man. I had no idea who he is.
And I <unk>, "<unk>, <unk>, do we know? I can't <unk> you."
And he said, "Well, you remember <unk> me.
When I first saw you, I <unk> you out of the <unk> of your mother. "
Oh, so.
And then, of course, but it did it.
This was Dr. <unk>, a man that I just <unk> from my mother <unk> on this day, because I, of course, very <unk> to <unk> my <unk>, two weeks.
The doctor for <unk> <unk> my mother was in the <unk>, and so my parents <unk> the man who <unk> me to the world at all.
And because I was born without <unk>, and my <unk>, after they had <unk>, and I was just a few <unk> on the other hand, he was the <unk>, that <unk> had to <unk> the bad news.
He said to me, "I had to <unk> <unk> parents that you never walk, and never <unk> his <unk> like the other kids or you never <unk> your <unk> life, and <unk> you just <unk> me."
<unk> <unk>, I found that he <unk> my entire childhood childhood, whether I had won't matter if I had won with a <unk> in the second <unk>, whether I had won with the <unk> at the <unk>, whether I had <unk> my <unk> or one of my <unk> <unk>, and he <unk> these <unk> to <unk> his students, <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk>.
And he called this part of his <unk> <unk>, the <unk> of the human <unk>.
You can't <unk> enough, like this <unk> can be <unk> for the <unk> of one person.
And Dr. <unk> <unk> <unk>, he said, "I've learned that kids, if they don't get a <unk>, and even when they're <unk> a little support, if you <unk> kids get a little support when you <unk> themselves, they can get a lot."
You see, Dr. <unk> has changed his thinking.
He had understood that the medical <unk>, and how someone <unk> with it, two different things.
And also I've been <unk> my thinking in the <unk> of time when they asked me about 15 years of age, whether I would have <unk> my <unk> against <unk> and <unk>, I would not have a second <unk>.
I wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk>.
If you ask me this today, I'm not sure.
And this is what I've <unk> with my <unk> and not <unk> of that <unk>.
And maybe this change could happen, because I'm so many people who have <unk> me <unk>, instead of <unk> people who wanted me to <unk> or <unk> me.
You see, it really only takes one person who <unk> you, how you can <unk> your forces, and you're through.
If you can allow someone to <unk> its own <unk> <unk>, <unk> forces -- the human <unk> is so <unk> -- if you do that, and for someone in a <unk> moment, you're a door for those people in a <unk> moment.
They <unk> them to open themselves.
The <unk> meaning of the <unk> <unk> "<unk> in the word" <unk> "<unk>."
It means something <unk> that is in a <unk> <unk>.
<unk>: What do we want to do now?
In the <unk>, in the U.K., there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk>.
They call this "<unk> <unk>" in the United States, we <unk> that as "<unk>."
<unk> are <unk> to <unk>.
And the A students are going to be <unk> <unk> <unk>, and so on.
They then have over a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a "<unk>" the <unk> "very well." They were told they were very <unk>, they were very <unk>, they were very <unk>. And after these three months, really
And of course, it <unk> to hear that <unk> <unk> was told the <unk>, they were just <unk>.
And then it was just as the three months.
But only those who were still in school -- <unk> from the <unk> who had <unk> school.
<unk> in this study was that the teachers were not <unk>.
The teachers didn't know that something was <unk>.
They were just saying that, they're the <unk>, and they're the students with the <unk> <unk>, and they <unk> them.
The only <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk>, a <unk>, the <unk> <unk>, no longer has hope, and he doesn't find anything more <unk> to him to <unk> our natural, <unk> <unk>, and our <unk> <unk> of <unk>.
But if we create it to support the human <unk> to <unk> the human <unk> to hope, to <unk> itself and other people around themselves and to be <unk> and then we're going to <unk> our forces.
If a <unk> about this <unk>, we can create a new reality and a new <unk>.
I want to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> that was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> called <unk> in the <unk> century, and that my friend <unk> <unk> <unk>, and the <unk> is called "The God, who knows," "" <unk>, "every child," every God, the name of God, the <unk> of the <unk>, the only one who knows, and that he's <unk>, "<unk> me."
<unk>, <unk> with me. Thank you.

A few years ago, here at TED, Peter Skillman, Skillman, Skillman's called "The Marshmallow-challenge."
The idea is similarly. Four-teams have to have the largest possible structure with 20 Spaghetti, about 1111 kleverage, about 111 kleverage, about 111 klebedge.
The marshmallow to be up up.
And, although it seems, it's really hard, because it's really hard to work very quickly.
And so I think that this is an interesting idea, and I've transformed it into a designant workshop.
It was a huge success.
Seiton, I've done about 70 workshops globally, with students, with students, developers and architting, even with CTOs, and even with CTOs, and there's something on this pharmaceutical, and there's something about it.
In fact, most people, the most people are involved themselves of the period of the period.
They talk about it, they overcome, how it's going to look at it.
Then a little bit of time in planning and organization. They skizing, and they care.
They investing a group of their time in the collaborative structures, consider structures consider structures.
And finally, shortly before they don't take a time, takes someone to the marshmallow, and they put it on the top, you put a step back and "Day!"
But what happens, almost always happened is that the "Day" is going to be, "because the weight of the marshmallows that the weight of the market lows that the entire thing is contained and it.
There's a series of people who have a lot more single than other, and under the worst are, under the worst of the worst are fresh button.
They lying, they're confused, they are confused and producing really, they're confused and professing.
And naturally, there are teams that have a lot more, and under the best is the fresh of the child gardless.
And that's amazing.
As Peter told us Peter told us the highest door, but also the most interesting structures of all.
What maybe they're wondering is: How does this come? What's this?
And Peter tells, "None of the children invested time in the Spaghetti GmbH."
They don't invest time in machine.
But there's a far reason.
And that By was trained to find the right Plan students to find a right Plan, OK.
And then to realize it.
What happens when they pack the marshmallow on the top, they have no time and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Clingt familiar, what?
What child garden kinds of garden kinds of mallow and prototypes, prototypes, successful prototypes, always with the marshmallow at the top, so that they have the multiple the multiple prototype.
Constructors are recognize these kinds of collaboration as a customers.
And with each trials, the kids get initial feedback, and what doesn't work.
So, the performance is to work with prototypes, but we see how different teams of teams.
The average for most of the is about 50,000 miles, BWLLLLLLLLLoot students of it, lawyers, but not a lot, they are better than the earlier.
Who is the most successful?
Archittle and engineers, to the Great.
11, the ceiling thing I've been looking at.
And why? Because they understand and make sure, and sure six self-a-self-a-self-stable pattern are the key to build stabious structures.
CEOs are lying something about average. But this is going to be interesting.
Now, you know an executive Administrator on the team, they're significant.
It's unbelievable. You see, and you can see, "Dieses team."
You can predict that. Would about this?
Because they have specific skills.
They left, they understand it.
And that team, and that's going to be seen, and it's going to be seen, significantly improve.
specialized skills and processing.
If you have 10 teams, the type, you get about six, you get about six, the stabious structures.
I tried to do something exciting.
I think we can bring the pocean.
So I offered a 10,000 dollars a price for the winner.
What do you think about these designant students?
What was the result?
This is what happened. No team had a stable structure.
If some who would have built a 2,500 feet, he would have built the price home.
So isn't it interesting that high content to have a strong effect?
We repeated this exercise with the same students.
What do you think happened?
Now, the advantage of the prototyping.
That's how it got out of the same, bad team of one under the best.
They were proven the highest construction in the lowest time.
There are deep lessons for us, about nature, about nature, about nature, about nature of contribution and success.
They like, wake, wake, you want to invest a marshmallow-challenge?
The reason is, I make digital waste and processes to help and processes to help Autos, video games and "visual effect."
And what the Marshmallow-Challenge is, she helps them to identify them.
Because every project has its own marketplace has its own marshmallow.
The challenge to a shared experience, a common language, a common language.
And this is the value of this experience, this is so simple exercise.
And the one of you who are interested in, can be marshmallowal.
It's a blog, where you see the marshmallows.
There's a writer writing.
They find examples from all the world, like people optimize and raffing.
There's also a character.
And the basal lesson, I think, is the construction is actually a connection.
It continues that we all put our senses on the sinside and that we use our thinking, how our feelings and our tune, in the challenge that's in the challenge that is
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience, everything it needs us to take away from a "uh -- to a" single "-- to get a" single "-- a" moment.
And this can make a big difference.
Thank you.
So, let's have a machine.
A big machine, a cool, a cool, TED-like machine, and this is a machine.
And everyone in this room has to go into this room.
And you can go into the past, you can go into the future; you can't go in the future; you can't stay in the right here and now.
And I asked what you would choose, because I asked my friends in last time, I asked my friends, and they wanted everybody to go into the past.
I don't know. They wanted to go back in the time before there was Autos or Twitter or "Ameria."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that you're kind of nostalgy, to wonder.
And I understand.
I'm not part of this group, I have to say.
I don't want in the past, and it's not because I'm a adventure.
It's because it's because mosquitions don't go back to this planet, they go forward.
So I want to go into this machine, and I want to go into the future.
This is the most great time that was ever on this planet, no matter, which was the scale, which is the scale, which is the scale, mobility, mobility, essential diseases.
There was never been a time like this.
My great-grandparents died everybody died when they were 60.
My grandparents were pleasure in 70s.
My parents are the 80 on the field.
So, there should be a nine at the beginning of my death.
But it's not about people like us, because this is a bigger thing.
A child that can be born today in New Delhi can expect to live so long as the richest man in the world.
Think about it. That's an unbelievable fact.
And why is this?
Please.
You've seen the demography of the Earth in a way that it didn't have a war ever made a war.
They're gone. They're disappeared.
We have them. Puff.
In the rich world, this existing millions of us only have a generation of one generation, even more.
Diphtery, spaces, child's paralysis.
You know, often overcome, what this is?
vaccine, modern medicine, our skills, our skills, billions of people, these are successful way.
And from my session is, the kinds of influencing things, look like it works, if it doesn't do it, one of the most great amazing area of humanity.
So that's the good news.
Unfortunately, this is the whole good news, because there's a few other problems, and they were mentioned.
And one of them is that despite all of our environment is a billion people in this world every day hungrice.
This paylows, and it's very quickly, and it's very quickly.
And not only that we've used our imagination to make this world foundly.
Trinky water, anticipating, rainforests, oil, Gas: She disappeared, and if we don't disappeared, and if we don't disappear out of this chaos.
So the question is: Can we do this? I think.
I think it's clear that we can use food, the billions of people who will be able to series, without that they live.
I think we can make this world with energy that doesn't destroyed them in the same time.
I think that, and no, no, that's not a wonder.
But this one of the things that keeps me at night -- one of the things that kept me at night, and we've never done as well as well as well as well as you know, yet never taken it.
And we've never been able to introduce it to him, as we can.
We are at the three-amazing, amazing events on many areas, and yet, I really think that we were going to go back to 300 years ago, we have to go back to a time that we have to fight in order to fight a time where we have been taught in which we have been taught.
People are beating in their beliefs, and that's so close that you can't free them.
No, the truth will refree.
And you know, everybody has a right on his opinion; even a right on his opinion.
But you know, what you don't have a right?
They have no right on their own facts. "
And I took a while to find out.
I wrote about a decades ago, I wrote an article about a decades for "New Yorker," a little article.
And I was amazing, on the resistance, in the contract of what the most effective of what the most effective scale of humanity.
I didn't know what I was doing, so I was doing, just what I was doing, so I wrote an article and drive.
And soon as I wrote an article about the crucial food.
The same thing, just larger.
People are playing crazy.
So I wrote a paper, and I couldn't understand why people were doing this, that would be "Frankkey," why they believe that molecules on a determolecules, and I couldn't make a transport way around the field of nature
But you know, I'm doing what I do. I wrote the article, I kept on.
I mean, I'm a journalist.
We put it, we walk, we go, that's okay.
But these articles made me worrying, and I couldn't find out why, and I could not find out why, and finally I found it.
And that's because this fanaticed that this fanaticed me wouldn't have fancient.
These were huge people, they were indeed people, they were indeed.
They were exactly like people in this room.
And that brought me through one.
But then I think you know what we're honest.
We're at a point where we don't have the same relationship to the same relationship like early.
We're talking about it.
We're talking about ironically, with a little leadership of this: "progress."
Oay, for this is there, and I think we know what reasons are these.
We have the confidence in institutions, in Autority, and sometimes lost in the tops, and there's no reason why it should not be that.
You can just call a few name, and people will understand.
Ternobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger, Vioxx, massive, the US-President, the US-Prensil.
I mean, you can choose their own list.
There are questions and problems with the people that we believe they would have right now.
Imagine you ask questions, evidence.
Take nothing to give you to.
But now, if you get evidence, you have to take these evidence, and we're not good.
And I can say this out of the reason we live in an epidemic of the furch, as I've never been able to see it and hopefully never going to see again.
For about 12 years ago, a history, a horrible story, a terrible story, the autish epidemic with the mass, massers, mumps, mumps and resources.
Very wonderful.
People were done to see whether this is true.
People are going to be done, that's a serious infection.
They came up.
They came out of the USA, from England, from Sweden, Sweden, from Canada, and they were all the same, no correlation, no correlation, no comment, not involved.
It doesn't make a difference. It doesn't make a difference because we
We don't believe in a bunch of documents from a government that given us, and I understand that I think we all do.
But you know what?
The result of it was catastrophal.
Catastrophal is because of this fact: The USA is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine.
That's scandal owner, and we should be shaped.
It's awful.
What happened is that we could do this.
Well, I understand that.
Because here has ever been mashing here?
Did a single in the audience ever die in the audience?
Pasn't very often.
Passion in this country doesn't catch, but 160.,000 mal in the world last year.
These are many death by masers, 20 per hour.
But because this doesn't happen, we can conpress it, and people like Jenny McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy McCarthy and analphabetic and Larry King Live.
And they can do it because they can't connect and correlation.
They don't understand that these things are equivalent, but almost never the same thing.
And that's something we need to learn, and it's very quickly.
Dieser guy was a hero, Jonas Slayer.
He's liberating us from one of the worst globe of humanity.
No fear, no squality, teaching, pleasure, disappeared.
The guy in the middle.
He's called Paul Offit.
He has been developed with a few other people who developed a road vaccine.
He can save the lives of 40,000 children a year in the developing countries in the developing world.
It's all good, not?
Well, this is good, deployed that Paul talks and talk about vaccines and says how valuable they are, and they're just saying how valuable they are, and people should be able to yamber.
And that he actually says this.
So Paul is a terrorist.
If Paul in a public approach, he can't require out, he cannot require weaker.
He goes at home, because the people love to tell them where his kids are going to tell where his kids are going to go to the shole.
And why? Because Paul has made a vaccine.
I don't need to say that, but vaccines are unlikely.
You know, you're going to continue the diseases, horrible diseases, and that's what happened.
We have now masers in this country.
And that's worse, and that's going to die, because this is just a question of the numbers.
And they won't just die to masers.
What about kinds of child? Do we don't?
A commiliton in my military, and I against a couple of writing, and I'm a bish.
No one has ever claims.
She wouldn't impact against child.
Fine.
Whium? Because we don't have child with child. And you know what?
We didn't have a celebrated child.
Today, I don't know, perhaps today morning in Lagos in Lagos, and it's just fly after Los Angeles, he's about Ohio.
And he's in a few hours, and he got a car, and he comes to Long Beach, and he's going to get one of these fantastic TED Dinner today night.
And he doesn't know that he infected with a disease, and we don't know that, because so the world works.
That's the planet that we live. Tun is not like it's not.
We love it to lie us to lie. We love that.
Do you have taken all your vitamine today?
Echinacea, a little antioxide that helps you to the swin you.
I know you've done this, because the Holfloor.
They take the stuff, and they take altering alternal care, and it doesn't make a difference, and it doesn't make a difference, we find out that they're useless.
They were able to constantly.
They silence your Urin. Morin. They don't do.
That's okay, you want to be 28 billion dollars for dark claims.
I agree with you.
Duncer. Duncle.
Where do we do this?
Well, I think I understand -- we hate the pharmaindustry.
We hate a strong government. We have no trust into the system.
And that's not. We should not be. Our health care system.
It's funny to millions of people.
It's absolutely cold and selecting yourself to us that can afford it.
So we walk away, and where do we go?
We run into the arms of the Placebo-industry.
That's super. I love the Placebo-industry.
But you know, this is a really serious issue, because the stuff is mistake, and we give billions of dollar.
And I have all kinds of a requisite here.
No of it -- Gingko, Betrug, Echinacea, Betrug, Acai, I don't even know what this is, but we give billions of dollars for it.
And you know what? When I say, they write me and say, "What's going to do it?"
So they feel good. "
And you know what? You have unprecedented.
Because it doesn't matter if it's the health minister, who says, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the charge of my experts to mamography, or some cancer salmography salmography salfine.
If you give up this Weg, where belief and magic Belege, and you know, you don't want to be.
They get to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa.
He brought 40.,000 of his people, because he involved that red bones, bone, bone, bone and citizens are much more effective than antiretroviral medication that we know that they can break the region of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of death in a sand that's worse than any other of this disease.
Please don't ask me that these things don't have consequences.
They have them. They always have them.
Now, the brain major epidemic in which we're just confident is this absurd camp between the confidence, is changing food and the bio-elite.
This is an idiotic delivered.
It's a debate about words, about metaphor.
That's ideology, not a conclude.
Everything we have, every series, every twice of Petersilie, every rosencohol, was changed by the people.
You know, there was no mandarines in paraise.
There were no Cantoupe-melons. There was no charge. We've done it all.
We did it in the last 1,11.,000 years.
And some of it has worked and some of them doesn't work.
We were less, we haven't worked.
Now we can do it. And we can do it, and naturally there are risks, but we can do something like vitamin A rice, and the stuff can help millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, millions of people, and we can do something like vitamin A
You don't want to do that?
I don't have to say that.
We lraise changed food.
Where do we do this?
Now, what I'm dying is: To many chemicals, pestifications, hormone, monoculture, we don't want to be given a huge field with one thing that's wrong.
We don't want companies to patent life.
We don't want companies seeds.
And you know what my Antwo-content to all of this is?
Yeah, you're right.
It's true, we've got a huge problem, but it's not a crucial problem.
That has nothing to do is.
It's right, moral, patent.
They know that the shapes is not a company.
She's not a single hand.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
She's a process, and sometimes it doesn't work, and sometimes it doesn't work, but the idea that we should not allow the idea that we should allow their work, because we're afraid is a transcle, and she hold millions of people from the sleep.
You know, in the next 50 years, we'll need to be 70 percent more food than the one.
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years.
Little.
They don't need them, and we don't give them.
And why?
We don't want people to make this slightly how to Maniok.
ManiOOK is something that's a half billion people.
It's like a cartoon.
It's just a bunch of calories. It's mies.
It doesn't have a proteins, it doesn't have a protein, and notes are blueprospected in it.
And then the people could not be able to be able.
You wouldn't make, and you know what?
That would be beautiful. It wouldn't
And everything I can tell is: Wail fight?
I mean, we wonder: Let's fight?
Because we don't want to take genes around?
It's not about to take genes around. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormone, our Beharring on larger food, better food, better food, better food.
It's not about Rice Crispies, it's about to keep people alive, and it's going to understand what it means.
Because you know what?
If we don't do that, if we do that as well as we're doing something that we think, I don't want to be schooling, I don't want to be a school tech colonialim.
There's no other description for what happens here is happening.
It's a self-advantage, it's our word, it's our word, and we really need to do it.
So after this unbelievable, you might want to say, "Will you want to say," Will you still in this ridiculous pleasure in this rigation? "
On every case. That's what I want to do.
In the moment, they put it in the present, but we have an unbelievable moment.
We can put this machine on everything we want.
We can move them, where we want to move them, and we will move them there, and we'll move them there.
We need to do these conversations, and we need to think, but if we get into the machine and get into the future, we're going to go to the future, we're going to be happy.
I know that we can, and so forever, it's a little thing that's now.
Thank you. Thank you.
When Steve Los Angeles, the Columnist the Los Angeles, a days, a date through the streets of Los Angeles, he heard a wonderful music.
She came from a man, an Amerian, sympathically, sympathically, obviously, obviously, who was just two set.
Many of you will know the story, because Steves, Steves were a book, which became a book, which was represented with Robert Downey Junior as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Founded to be the targeted by the Crivent's discovered by the Crivent's discharged.
It was a nutritious Juilliard, he ended a newspaper and 30 years later, he lived as an Obdays later, he lived on the streets of Skid Row in the center of Los Angeles.
I remember you all, to read Steve, or to read the film, so you don't only understand the wonderful relationship between these two males, but also, like the music on the two male, the music that is allowing, and how it finally the music was allow-instrent, that word was allowly, this worry.
I met Mr Ayers in 2008, two years ago, in the Wold Disney Conct Hall.
He had just heard a conduction of Beethova, and faiery senses, and I came behind the stage to imagine.
He talked to a very hot and healed ton about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton, and how the Dodgers would never make the Baseball World Series would be, and this all because of the topic passenger of the first mind of Ethoil.
We got to talk to the topic music, and a few days later, I got an email in who was interested in my own textygen for me.
I have to mention more that the conversation is a medical treatment, because it was already with electricity, because it was already with electricity and tracells and hands, a dream, a dream that has been successful, and that's been successful.
And it's been especially at this point for these schizophrenia phases, they are sometimes so bad that they're totally though, and it's walking in the streets of Skid Rowns and the field of skid Row, and the founded of a road of his own stomer.
And in exactly this kind of a serious stage, when we first started with our first hour of the Disney Concert Hall, and he had lost this irre flaces in his eyes and effective.
He talked about invisible demonstrate and route about it, like someone in the sleep.
I was scared, not meant, but I was afraid, I could lose him that he could be involved in his conditions, and that I could destroy his relationship to the girl, if I started to destroy about tone-stress and other exciting shapes of dividing deo.
So I just started to play.
I played the first sentence of Beethovens.
And while I was playing, I found that in the same way, thanarily, a completely completely completely change.
It was when he stood under the influence of an invisible doctor, a chemical reaction, which catalysator was my game.
It was a very anticipated in understanding, in an understanding, in a run curiosity and anmut.
And as a wonder, he started his mind, and started to play to the site of the Violin-concessed, and then asked me, then they asked me to play them, and then they asked me to play them, Sivil.
We then started to speak about music, they catched by Brhm, Bram, Bram, Brick and all the other Bs, and all the other Bs, and all of the other Bs, and all of the other Bs, and all the other Bs, and all the other Bs, and all of the other Bs, and all the other Brahs, and all of the other Bra
And I realized he didn't just just have an encyclothes about music, but it's also made a personal relationship.
He talked about her with a passion and a understanding that I was just from my colleagues in the philharmony of Los Angeles.
After music played and talked about music, was from this paranoids, confused man, who had been celebrated by Los Angeles, a low-workplace, a low-worked musician.
music is medicine. music changes us.
For conclude, the music is a single health.
Because the music allows allows, his thoughts and election with his imagination and creatures with his imagination and creature in something realm.
And so he discovered his circumstances.
I understood that this is the creature of art.
And this is the reason we do music: so we can do something that in all of us, deep our feelings, our feelings, our feelings, through our creature, by our creating creature.
And the reality of this expression of the express of us, and moving, inspired and under, inspired and discovered us.
Finally, they went, so the music, the music back into a geminity of friends.
The environmental force brought him back into a filamy of musicians who realized him, who was invented his talent and saved him.
And I'm going to be a little bit of music, whether is Disney Concert Hall, or in Skid Row, because he reminds me, why I was a musician.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you.
Robert Gupta.
Robert Gupta: I want to play something that I would like to play something that I've been indeed.
I hope you've seen me.
I am Jane McGonigal. I design competition.
I've been developing online for 10 years now, and my goal for 10 years, and my goal for the next decade, to save the world in the reality of the world in the reality of the world in the reality of how it's in online play.
I have a Plan for this. I want to convince more people, including a lot of you to spend more and great games.
We're going to spend three billion hours per Woch with online games.
Some of you might think, "That's a whole lot of time."
Maybe something too much time, if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world.
In fact, my research to the institution for the future, is exactly the opposite.
Three billions of hours per Wodom are not enough to solve the world.
In fact, I'm convincing that if we want to live the next decade on this planet, we need to be more dramatically.
I calculated that the time at 21 billion hours of game is in 21 billion hours a white.
It's going to take something away, so I can take a little bit, so I can do it, so it can be: If we want to solve problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, global conflict and fetal affection, I think we need to try, games online for leverage 21 billion per hours a billion per hours per hours per
No, to play the end of the next decades. No, I really serious.
Whium? Dieses describes to you.
And why I think that games are so unless expecting for the human species in the future.
This is a portray of the photographer Phile Toledano.
He wanted the feelings of play, so he made a camera. So he built a camera.
This is one of the classic express.
If you're not a player, maybe some of the nuancer in this level.
You probably see this competing, something scared, something fear, but also also the first concentration, very, very, very crucial conction in the solution of a real difficult problems.
If you play, some nuances here, some nuances here, and the mouth are a sign of optimism, and the eyes of optimism.
This is a player that's on the edge of a white is a series.
Oh, you know. OK. Prime. Prime.
So we have some players here.
A episism is a result that is so ooverpossible is that you didn't know that it was possible.
It was allowed to the image of imagination, and if you create it, you're shocked.
In fact, you're actually able to do this. That's an epissing.
Diescent player is a short.
And this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solutions in the world, if we take the door of the next year, when we take the door of the face of a epical sea.
Well, let's look at this face, we look at this face in real life, when we met hard problems.
I remember it as the "In life, I'm bad" In life. "
And it's my face, you see? OK.
That's me, like I'm doing this in life, I'm bad "In life."
This is a graffiti in my foreign homes in Berkeley, California, California, where I studied in play better than the real life.
This is a problem that's a lot of players.
We don't think we are not as well as well as well as play.
And I don't just mean my legal, even though that's heard about it.
We are rich in game worlds.
I mean, in the collaborative of motivation, inspired to do something meaning, inspired to the collaboration.
If we are in a game, I think that many of us are transforming in our best version, every time, and immediately helpful, hardly, hardly, hardware, to try to solve the problem, it's been requiring, it again, it required by the way.
And in reality, if we failed, if we do, we feel often different.
We feel overwhelmingly. We're feeling. We're feeling. We may feel depressed, perhaps or cynic.
And these feelings we've never play if we play games in play, there's no.
And that's what I wanted to study as a doctorn.
Why is it impossible to think of games, you couldn't just be able?
How do we translate these feelings of games into reality?
So I looked at games like World of warcraft, which is the ideal environment for problems.
And I have asked some things that make the epical sea in online walls so possible.
So, first, if you put in one of these online games, especially at world of wacraft, there's a lot of different characters that are ready to trust you to a global mission, and it's immediately.
But not just any kind of mission, but a mission that perfect your reaction in the game, right?
So you create that.
You never get an elevator that you can't solve.
But always at the edge of your skills, so you have to do.
But there's no job in World of warcraft, and you're not sitting around and turns around and turns out there, and it's always made a lot of things.
And there's a case of employees.
Whereas well, hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to calculture.
We don't have that easy to be so easy, this feeling in a fingerticipation.
And there's this epic story, this inspiring story, this inspired story, why we are, and what we're going to do.
They have distinct by "Level high," and "A strength" or "A intelligence."
Dieses constants of Fedback, there's no real life.
If I walked these stage, I didn't have: A speech and a lot of a crazy idea, a single idea.
I don't get this feature.
So, the problem of Coopera, the copera, like World of warcraft is that it's so terribly satisfy, every time in the Rande of a episode that we love our entire time in these games.
They're just better than the reality.
By today, all the World of warcral player, 5.93 million years, with the virtual problems of Azeroth.
It's not a little bad thing.
It might be smart.
But to see it in the context: Time 5,93 million years ago, our first primates started to the primates.
So the first exciting prime.
OK, so if we're talking about how much time we spend to play with games, that only makes sense when you talk about games, you know, the time in the scale of human development in front, which is extraordinary.
But it turns out, because it turns out that we use, by using this whole time, we use this all the time, we are in the limb, to be able to people in the elite.
We're developing us to conversation, crucial creature.
That's the truth. Daran is I believe.
Betrate you to this interesting statistics, the recently of a researchers of the Carnegie Mellon University: The average young human from today: The average young human culture in a single culture, 1,000,000 hours.
So, 10,000,000 hours is an extremely interesting shop, two reasons.
First, for children in the USA, 10,0080 hours, which they spend up in the shole, from the 5th class to the level of the 5th classroom, and so we've got to a competition here, so we've got a complete here, so we have a compared here, so we have a combine a. So we have here here is here,
parallel model, in which young people learn to what it means to be a good player, what it means to be a good game.
And perhaps some of you have the new book of Malcolm Gladwell, and so you know, you know, "So you know," so you know his theory of the success, the theory of the success of 10,000 hours.
It's based on the great research of cognitive context that if we were 10,000 hours with the smart studium of a popular tops to the 21st of life, we're going to get to the mind.
We're going to be so good at how the most meaningful people in the world.
So, what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the mastery players.
So, the big question is, "What are player is powerful?"
Because if we could figure that out, we never have been wonderful of human potential human potential potenti
So many people in the world, we've spend a hour, which is at least a hour per day.
These are our master players.
And the next decade, we have another billion player, which is extraordinary, which is extraordinary.
If you haven't heard it yet.
The game industry developed consoles that the energy are and in the message, instead of the broken band-Internet, so that player around the world, especially in India, in China, Brazil online.
You're expecting a billion player in the next decade.
So we've got 1.5 billion player.
So I have to cut up what it is, what it is, what it is to do is to miles us.
Here's the four things I found. As the first thing: Dring optimism.
OK, imagine like extremely self-motivation.
Dringing optimism is the desire to do something, to mostly mostly, to mostly calculate with the beliefs that we have a founded hope on success.
Player always believe that a epical seat is possible, and that it's always low-hours, and it's the same.
Player don't sit around.
Player are master in the spider of social nets.
There's a lot of interesting investigations that show that we have more people like, after we played with them, even when they were asked us.
The reason for this is that there's a lot of trust to play a game.
And we trust that someone has been sbringing to us that the rules are involved that we have the same goal, and until the game of it.
So the collaboration that allows from the growth of individuals, trust and mix.
And we're going to blue, we're going to blow social relationships.
Glacious productivity. Fantastic!
You know, there's a reason why the average word of warcral word of warcral player, 22 hours per Woky, as well.
The reason is that if we're playing, we're actually happy to work hard, when we're dealing or nothing.
We know that we're going to work as human beings, if we do hard, meaningful work.
And players are ready to work hard to work when they get the right thing.
And finally, epical meaning.
Players love to be part of the major missions of planetary case.
So here's a background, and you know, you know, you know, all of the Wikipedia, the largest Wikipedia, the largest Wikipedia, the largest Wikipedia, the largest Wikipedia, the largest Wikipedia, and they
The second biggest Wiki in the world, with almost 80,000,000 is the World of warcraft Wiki.
Fiillions of people use it every month.
They have more information about World of wacraft in the Internet than any other issue in any other issue in any other issue of the world.
They create an epical story.
They create an epical source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft.
OK, so these are vier supercruments that lead to a single result, gamers are super-powerful, hopeful, hopeful Individence.
They are people who believe they can change the world.
And the only problem is that they think they can change the virtual whols, but not the real whols.
That's the problem I try to solve.
Edward Castronova is a volunteer.
His work on genius. He study why.
People spend so much time, energy and opportunity to spend up energy and yourself in online.
And he says, "We're not going to be stuff of a massenemigration in virtual whols and online played."
And this one from an economist. So he's logical.
And he says -- No, I'm developing games, I'm a little bit overwhelmingly.
So he says, this is actually sensitive, because players can reach more lives than in the real life.
You can cut in games stronger social bonds than the real life, and they get more retrements in the real life.
So, he says, it's totally completely logically that players are more time in the virtual world than the real world.
I just agree with it, this is logical.
But it's definitely no optimaling.
We need to start transform the real world into a game.
My inspiration comes from an event that is going to take 2,500 years.
There are these anticipation, from sheep cuttle. You know?
This fantastic players, there was a sheet scales.
And they were, the first of people developed played played, and if you're familiar with the Werks of the old Greek's herodotus, maybe you know this story, and the story of how games have been recorded.
Look at Modotus, games were, in the knife, in the knees of lydirty.
There was one of these big hungry hunctional that the queen of lydirty of Lydien idea.
People were fight. People were fight.
It was an extreme situation. You took an extremely solution.
So, she invented, loud, the word game, and the desire of a day, you would be able to do it, and you would play a day, you would play a day.
And they would be so much in the curious games, because games are so fascinating, and pledge, happy productivity that they were forgotten to forget that they were forgotten.
And then, the next day, you would play. And the next day, you would do.
And loud Modotus convictory, they were 18 years of these hungry, by a day and played.
And I think, I think, we put games in the same way.
We put games in order to get the real world, and we put games in order to deal with everything that doesn't work in the real world, everything that doesn't work in real life, everything that is not works in the real life, and we'll get out of games.
But it doesn't have to be the end.
That's the spanna.
Look at Modotus, after 18 years, the hungry, so decided to be a final game.
They shared the queen in two.
They played a cute game, and the degrees were breaking to a epical adventure.
They were lyedia and made on the search for a new homework, and they were just so many people back as much as they were able to survive and searching with the rest of one where they could.
That sound crazy, right?
But new DNA evidence is that the Etrusers, who are the roughly biled the rushed, the same DNA like the old lydier.
And so, they would have a single conception that hearodotus, that hearodotus, is actually true.
And geologists were going to have a global refrigeration that took almost 20 years, which was the hungry.
So this crazy could be immediately.
Maybe they were saved their people in the games by games, by the games of games in the games, and then they were able to play so much about the middle of civilization, and so much about the entire civilization.
So, we can.
We've been playing in 1994.
This was the first strategic game in real time.
The World of Warcrash Serie. That was 16 years ago.
They played 18 years, we've been played for 16 years.
I hold, we're ready for our own epical game.
So, she sent the hold of her civilization on the search after a new world. And so I take my 21 billion dollars per waste.
We should come to the hour, that the hour of a hour per day with games, and we solved the problems of the real world.
I know you're going to ask, "How do we solve problems of the real world.
In play? "And that's right?" And that's what I've done in the last few years.
We have this banner in our office in Palo Alto, it express like we should understand the future.
We don't want to try to say the future.
What we want to do is is to create the future.
We want to imagine the best possible. And then people to explore this idea in reality.
We're going to give us epical seat and give people people the melities to reach them.
I'm going to show you three games that I designed to try to make people to make epical sea in their own future.
This is "world without oil."
The game is from 2007.
It's an online game where you have to oil a single path.
The ecapphenomenon is content, but we have enough online content, so it will be region for you, and you actually live your real life without oil, so if you're going to be a game, you tell us where you're walking, you know where you're not showing you how much oil, what you know, you know, how much ownership oil, which you know
It's like transportation, whether the schools are closed whether it's transportation, and you have to figure out how you were true. And we ask you to invite you to introduce video or photos.
We've tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007, and we've been tested over the last three years.
And I can tell you, it was a changing experience.
Nobody wants to change his life, because it's good for the environment or because we should.
But if you're in a epical adventures, "OK the oil."
This is a fascing adventure that you're going to.
Find the way you could survive, and most of our players have learned that they have learned in the game.
So we've got a bigger, for the next one, higher, higher goal, higher goal, higher goal.
We've developed the game "Superstruct" the Institute for the future.
And at the time, the computation of a supercomputer that people have only only 23 years on the planet.
Dieser supercomputers is called "Global exercise, sensitive system," naturally.
The After of player, we were almost like a "Jerry-Bruckheimer" movie
You know, Jerry Brucks, where it's the Dream-team, and they can save the astronauts, the passers can save ex-sheet, and they can save the world.
But in our game, instead of only five people, let's say, everybody is in the thream-team, and it's our personal, and it's our performance, health, security, health, security and future of social ju
8,000,000 players players were player landed.
They found 500 unbelievable creative solutions that you can read when you "superstruction," Google.
And the last game, we bring out the 3th, and it's a game in collaboration with the Weltbank.
If you closed the game, you get from the Weltbank, the scale of the Socience, "Social surveys," Socil of 2010.
We're working with universities in the very very black Africa and we put them to social environment.
We have a comic about it. We have "Level high for regional consumption, knowledge, sustainability, vision, sustainability, vision and infall.
I want you to share all of you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world, especially in developing professionals that professional entrepreneurs to save the world.
I come to the end.
I want to ask you something.
What do you think happens when you think about it?
We have these fantastic players, we have games that show us what we can do, but we haven't saved the real world.
Well, I hope that you can agree that gamers are human resources that are human resources that we can put on work in real life, and that games have a big meaning for change.
We have these entire supercruments, happy productivity, happy productivity, the ability to celebrate social nets, Dring-optimism and the relationship to epism.
I really hope that we're playing causes, and it's a far male to survive on this planet.
And I hope you're going to be designed with me and play with these games.
If I look at the next decades, I'm sure in two things: that we can create every imaginary sustainable, and that we can create all possible games, so I'll walk, let's go. So, I'm going to let the games begin.
Thank you.
Since some time, I'm interested in the Placebook effect. It may seem strange, it seems to be a magic for it, it's because you look like, you're looking at it as "a dreaming that will think about something real when I think of a dreaming that will believe."
In other words, sugar pills in some studies, in some studies, in some studies, the Placebook effect, and it's only because the person thinks what happens is because the person thinks what happens is a pharmactic or a kind of -- is a kind of pharmatic, there's a pharmacent, for example, there's a patient, for example, there
It's a deception is going to take something real, because someone else is so true
So we also understand that, I want to understand you now, I want to show you an elementary magic, very simple
And I'm going to show you how he works. This is a trick that has been at least for the 1950s in every magic book for children.
I even even made him from the Cub Scence Magic of the padfining in the 1970s.
I'm going to explain for you and then explain it.
And then I'm going to explain why I explain him.
So, you see what happens.
The knife you can study; my hand you can study.
I'm going to keep the knife so in my farmers.
I'm going to take back.
And to make sure that nothing in my image or coming out of my download, I'm just going to get my hands, I'm just going to sure my hands.
And you can see that, you can see that at any time, at any time, I'm going to push out here, nothing in my slowly or come out.
And the goal is quite simple.
I'm going to open my hand, and hopefully, if everything goes well, the knife is going to be free by metric.
It actually sits so far on his phrase that I can shake it, without the knife.
Nothing works in mind, or comes out, no tricksing, no tricksing, and you can study everything.
Ta-da!
Well, this is a trick that I often smart little kids who are going to be a lot about magic for magic, because you can learn a lot about disappeared, even though it's a very simple trick.
So, many of you know in the hell of this trick.
He's works that we do.
I think the knife in my hand.
I saying that I sleeping my hands to make sure that nothing in my slings or come out in my slings or come out, and that's a lie.
The reason why I felt my hands, is that it's the content of the illusion of the illusion.
In the moment, where I turned my hand from you can see them away from the side of you, so this finger, this finger, this finger, just from there, just where he was in a position where he was in a position where he's so exstined.
Please trick?
There was someone who had no child.
So, he's here. It's right.
And if I turn around, the finger changes his position.
And now, you could talk about why this is a deception, why you don't think that's just three finger: because of the constant, and the way it works like the information, they don't claim, and the way it's information, they don't cut, one, two, but she looks as a group
But this is not true. And then I open my hand.
Of course, it's going to be flowing, but not the magic of my physics, but by a trick, by mine that's now.
And if I left my hand, the same thing happened by saying, the same thing by turning to the movement that the finger is movement.
I take this hand away. And here's the knife.
That trick you can prevent your friends and neighbors. Thank you.
Now, what does this have to do with the Placebook effect?
A year or so, I read a study that really really really true.
I'm not a doctor or researchers, and that's why it was a amazing thing.
It turned out to be the pille: If you put a Placebo in a form of white pille, in the form of a white pille, in the form of an aspirintling, that's just a single fitting.
But if you change the shape that you describe the Placebo, for example, in a smaller pille, and these blue farming a letter, and it's actually measure more effective.
And that, although no one of them -- it's a pharmaceutical -- it's bad accidents.
But a white pille is not as well as a blue pille.
What? That was really flipping me.
It turns out that it's not all.
If you take caps, they're still more effective than a tablets every shape.
It's a farming chaper that is on a bottom and the other, is better than a white chapl.
The dosis is playing a role.
A pille twice, is not as good as three pills -- I can't remember the gene statistics. So I'm sorry.
The decisive is.
... that the dosito play a role.
And the shape plays a role.
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effect, you have to pull out.
Right? A third of a third, a few billion of an effective substance that you were injecting a patient.
It creates a very strong bild in the head. That's very much stronger than a white pille.
This graph is really -- I'm going to show you another mal, if we have a projector.
So, the white pille is that the white pille doesn't look as well as the blue pille that doesn't make as well as a chapse that doesn't make as well as the way the pille of the way that the pille.
And nothing about it, some really pharmaceutical property, and it's just our belief that has made a stronger of us.
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick.
I take something that is obviously a deception, and I'm going to look at it.
We know from that study is that you have to be able to be able to do when it's going to do it.
This is a 18 inches long tape, and it's very, very, very distant, and I'm going to stop it.
This is really my meat. It's not Damian special meat.
This is my skin. This is not a special effect of hollyesis.
I'm going to go through the skin my skin, and through them, until they go through it, until it down, until they go back to the other set.
If you're wrong -- if you're slightly silence, I have a couple of friends, in the hotel room, and some people who I didn't know, and some people who I didn't know, and some people who I didn't know, and it's almost high-powered.
So I sleep in front of you, if you're going to look at the next 30 seconds, you know what I'm going to do the first smart
You can see it same, you can see it away, if you want to see.
So, it goes right here, where my meat at the bottom of my arm, I'm just going to do you.
To me real. Are you crazy this crazy?
And now just a little bish through my skin and on the other set of sweet, and on the other set of the slightning.
Now, we're conceived in the same situation that we had in the same situation.
It's about.
But now you can't count my finger, right?
So, I'm going to show you. That's one, two, three, vier, five.
Well, yes, yes
I know what people think if you see it.
They say, "OK, that's not so far and containing yourself, the skin, only to stop us."
Now, I'll show you.
So what does this look like? Well, this is all good.
Yeah, I know. And people are saying, "OK. I didn't go right."
People are coming into the side of the side of the side of the side of the side.
Let me show you from the name.
That's really my skin. That's not a special effect of hollyesis.
That's my meat, and I can turn it around.
So I'm sorry. If you're wondering, look away, you don't look at.
People stopped or who see this later, sometime on video, say, "Well, that's right, it looks pretty awful, but if it was
OK, let me give you a little bit of button for you.
Yeah, here's it.
Normously, I would take a little bit of true.
I'd like to make an arm poor and show you that there are no wounds.
But I think in this frame here, and with the intention, and with the intention, I'm just going to get the tracking there, I'm just going to go in and so from the stage.
We're going to meet in the next few days.
I hope you're free to it. Thank you very much.
So I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I just loved two.
Diescent first, this was more like a slightning.
It was a beautiful fish, good consistence, good consistency, a consistent on the spirit.
What a fish.
Noke better, he was taken to the Aquaculture to the highest standards of sustainability.
So you could feel like to sell it.
I had a relationship to this beauty about a few months.
One days called the front of the Firma, and asked if I could contribute to the sustainability of the farm.
"Of course," I said.
Here was a company that was a company that was a completely problem for our kiss. How do we kept fish on our key, and how do we kept fish on our mindset?
In the last 50 years, we've been a little bit like we've been focused on the ocean.
It's hard to overwhelmed.
90 percent of the big fish that we love, the theme, the tuna, the tuna, the tuna, the single, they're collected and they are collected.
It's almost nothing.
So, even three-action, focus, fishing, fishing, is a part of our future.
Many arguments against it.
He's got a provement of 15.
That means that, 15 points are necessarily needed to get a pounds of accidents.
No, very sustainable.
Scotton not very well.
So, finally, finally, a company that tried to do it right.
I wanted them to support them.
At the day, I called the past, I called the the public of the public work for the Firma.
Let's call it Don.
"Don," I said, "only to have the facts right, you're famous to look at the way outside in the ocean to look at the ocean that their environment."
"That's true," he said, "We're so wrong that the waste is confront of our fish, not focus."
And he added to, "We're basically a own world.
This is a provocation of 2.5, "he said."
"The best in the industry."
2.5, big powerful.
"2.5, what? What do you do?"
"sustainable proteins," he said.
"Groting," I said. Let. Let.
And that nice I lay in the bed and it was a sustainable protein?
So I called the next day, I was the next day, Don.
I said, "Don, what are sustainable proteins?"
He said he doesn't know. He won't.
Well, I finally got a few people in the Firma. No one could give me a download.
Let's take it to Don.
"Don," I said, "What are sustainable proteins?"
Well, he mentioned some of the algae, and then he said, chicken pellets.
I said, "Hean Pellets?"
He said, "Yeah, feds, bone masses, represented, restling and processing."
I said, "How much percent of your feature is chicken?"
Or maybe two percent.
"Well, this is about 30 percent," he said.
I said, "Don, what is sustainable to fly chicken to fish?"
There was a long pause in the protection and he said, "There's just too much chicken on the world."
I floved by this fish.
No, not because I'm a self-driven genuity and Great.
I'm actually.
No, I actually decided to take this fish, because, I'm beautiful at God, who has taken after that conversation was taking.
Diescent two fish, this is a different kind of love story.
It's the romantic kind of, the kind of thing that you learn the fish, you learn the fish, you're learning the fish.
I first took him in a restaurant in South spania.
A journalistics had been talking about a long time of this fish.
She's swallowed us.
He came to the table with a little bit, almost significant color.
The coch had founded him.
Hold two times.
It was still amazing, he was still curious.
Who can leave a fish so far, after he was descooking?
I can't, but this guy can.
Let's take Miguel. In fact, he's called Miguel.
And no, he doesn't have the fish, and he's not a coch.
He's a biologist at Veta La Palma.
This is a fish on the South Western corner of Spiens.
It's a mountains of the river Guadalquivir.
Bis in the 1980s, the farm in the hands.
They were crushed in what was basically field was based on the field.
They made it by doing that, they did the land readers.
They built these floor of cases of cants, and they were pushing water out of the sand and down into the floor.
Well, they couldn't make it happen, it wasn't floor.
And ecologically, it was a disaster.
It brought about 90 percent of the violent of what this place is for this place a lot of genetics.
And so in 1982, in 1982, an Firma's free with environmental conscious.
What did they do?
You've got around the floor of the water.
They literally made the Hebel.
Instead of the water out of the water.
They fluded the canals.
She showed a 1,0000,000 hectar fish -- Bark, sea, garnele, Aal -- and they have miguel and his firma cological destruction of the ecological destruction of the ecological de
The farm is unbelievable.
I mean, you've never been looking at this.
They stress out on the horizon, who is a million miles, and everything they see, everything they're seeing kinds of it, and all of them, and this threw tail.
I wasn't a long time with miguel.
He's an unbelievable guys, three Teile Charles Darwin and part of "a crocodil to kissing."
Oay? There were we and fight through the field, and I'm going to make us, and I'm going to be switched to miguel, and Miguel, and Miguel has a biologic discovery.
And here he's a rarely rare.
Now, he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
And here, he looks a pattern of bunks that reminds him to the Tanananian graffe.
It turns out that Miguel has spent the biggest part of his career in the micumi park in Africa.
I asked him how he had become a fish experts.
He said, "I don't know about fish.
I'm an expert for relationships. "
And then he goes and sticks in the rules of rare birds and algae, and strangers, and strange and whatever plants.
And you don't understand me, that was really fascing, you know, the biotic gemination, you know, the biotic geminity.
It's great, but I was flowing.
And my head was weak about this described piece of ceast fish, which I had at the tonight.
So I have him subject. I said, "Miguel, how does it come so well?"
He showed up the algae.
"I know, the young, the Algains, the phytoplankton, the relationships, that's unbelievable.
But what do your fish?
How is the processing? "
Now, he's been able to tell me that it's such an amazing system, is that the fish, that the fish.
The planttary biomass, the phytoplankton, the Zooplankton, that's what the fish further.
The system is so healthy, it's completely self-renewables.
There's no front.
The one farm of a farm that their animals don't far their animals?
Later, I went to this founding at this basic backwards, and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems to be so naturally," different than any college that I've ever ever ever had been, "How miss do you?"
In the moment, it was when a film of a film regisset.
And we flowing around the corner, and the most unbelievable view, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of flamingos, a literally pinker, I've been the eye.
"That's success," he said.
"Look Dir their trees, pink.
They bad. "
Bad? I was completely confused.
I said, "Miguel, bad they don't bad your fish?"
"Yes," he said.
"We lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing cheap.
Now, last year was on this basic sticky 60,000,000 people, more than 250 different ways.
It's the biggest privogle reservation in Europa.
I said, "Miguel, is a good thriving bird of bird of bird, you want to have a fish?"
He shadow, no.
He said, "We're looking at extensive, not intensive.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos are the garnelen.
The garnels are flowing the phytoplankton.
So, the pinker of the pinker, the system. "
OK, let's think about it. A farm that their animals don't feed, and a farm that their success on health.
A fishing, but also a bird reservation.
Oh, and we should not be in the flamingos of prevent.
They brought up in a city of 240 kilometers away, where the ground.
Every morning fly, they fly into 240 kilometers.
And every night, they fly back 240 kilometers.
They do this because they can do the writing white line of the Way A92.
It's walking.
I had imagined a journey of the penguins, so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, fly, they fly back 240 kilometers back the farm and then they fly back to the night?
Do they do it for the kids? "
He looked at me when I was a song of Whitney Houston.
He said, "No. They do this because the food is better."
I don't mentioned the skin of my loved fish, who was custly, and I don't like fish, and I don't like it. I don't like it.
It's this one, single, salmon.
I'll calmost never do with it.
And yet, when I proved it in South spania, she wasn't tasted after fish.
It takes sweet sweet and you, as if you would take a bissing from the Ozean.
I mentioned this to Miguel and he nailed.
He said, "The skin is works like a swamm.
It's the last night, before something in the correct.
She's developed in the region of evolution to exploration. "
And then he added up to, "But our water doesn't have a crines."
Oay. A farm that doesn't further their fishing, and a farm that their success is the success of the success.
And then I realized, if he says, a farm that doesn't have influenced, he walked, because the water that flows through this flows out of the flows that flows out of the fluss Guadalquivir.
It's a fluss that leaders all the things that are taking out of these days to lead them, chemical practice, chemical practice of girls.
And if it has fought through the system, and this complete, and this is the water sauberer than how it is.
The system is so healthy, it's the water.
So not just a farm that their animals, not just a farm, not only a color that's their success on the health, but a college that is literally a farm that is literally a farm, and not just for these fish, but I'm not just for those fish, and not just for those fish, but also for the way I.
Because when the water flows out, it inside the Atlantic.
One puts in the Ozean, I know, but I take him, and that you should do, because this love the local history of how romantic is also, it's also a strange of how romantically, is also definitely.
You could say that it's a recipe for the future is good food, whether we're talking about Bark or floor floor.
So what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture, from one, in the food, from one, in the food.
But for many people to radical it's a bigger.
We're not a region. We're a lover. We're
We love the woxide markets. We love little familience, and we love talking about regional food. We're
And if you caught that these are things that are the future, the future is good food somewhere and says, "Hey, I love," Hey people, I love, I love, I love pink flamingos, but how are you going to get the world?
How are you going to do the world? "
Do I be honest?
I don't like this question.
No, not because we have enough calories to reduce more than just to series.
A billion people are going to hungry.
One billion -- it's more than ever -- it's more than ever -- floor crassers in the distribution, not the total production.
Well, I don't like this question, because it has been the logic of our food system has been the last 50 years.
Fify greatest practice, the girls of a monoculses, chemicals on the Earth, chemicals on the Earth, chemicals, and all the time, the agencies, and all the time, and all the time, "If we have more cheaper?"
That was the mountain. It was the legacy. It was the legal.
We should call them what it is, a popular in the development, a promise, which allows quickological capital, which allows this production.
That's not a job, and it's not a agriculture.
Our corncamber is taught, not functional, not floor, but representing resources.
It's not by the new metrics and tract inventions, but by the fresh fresh, not by pumps, not by pumps, but by fresh water, not by fresh water, and not by fish, and not by fish, and not by fish.
They want to do the world to do?
Let's start with the question: How are we going to do it for yourself?
Or better, how can we create conditions, how can we create conditions that have every gone of the gigantic?
To do that, don't look at the Agroup model for the future.
It's really old, and it's done.
Capital, chemistry and machines are in it, and it has never been produced to food.
Let's look at the ecological model.
That's what it is that in two billions of years of labor experience.
Look at Miguel, farmers like Migu
Betrics that are not wools to restore, representing bedroom, the represent, containing the extensively, intensively intensive, not only intensive, but experts for relationships.
Because they are the ones that are also experts for taking.
And when I'm really honest, they're a better coch than I'm going to be yourself.
You know, that's right, because if that's the future is good food, it's going to be cave.
Thank you.
I grew up with a gear portion Science fiction.
In my schools, I was driving with the bus, every day, a hour, every day was a hour.
And my nose always in a book, a scitizens of fiction book, which was made my thoughts in others, and on telling my deep-single deep in me, unremarkable curiosity.
And this curiosity showed that I was always when I was not in the shole, through the walls of the streams, and snails and snails and snails and snails and snails, everything home and snails, everything home and wrote the microscop.
I was totally excited, you know.
It always went to the world to understand the world, and the limits of the world.
And my love to Science fiction seemed to fiction in my environment, because in the late '60s, we flew to the moon and research.
Jacques Cousteau came in our well-intriguing, in our living room with his fascing animals and places, and a world full of wonder that we could never have imagined.
And that's allowed to the fiction of fiction role.
And I was an artist.
I could draw. I could paid.
And there's either the video games that overset of computing with computer generated films the entire imagination in the media landscape, I had to create the images in my head.
And that's what we had to do, when we were a book, we took a book, we took the description of the asutors and projected them on the screen in our heavily.
My reaction on it was the sign and mals of outmagic, extraordinarian, extraordinary wholds, robots, spaceshistory, and all of that.
In Mathemselves, I was constantly understood by the teacher, like I was hidden, hanging around.
Certained in some way.
And something interesting, something interesting, what happened to me in Jacques Cousteof fascinated, the thought was a completely unknown world here on our Earth.
I wouldn't do anybody, I wouldn't make an explore world with a spaceship, and that seemed me.
But here was a world that I could actually remained, here on Earth, and she was fascing in the same way, and exotic like all I had been introduced to these books.
So I decided when I was 15, I decided to be diverse.
The only issue was that I lived in a small village in Canada, 1,000 miles from the next Ozean.
But I wasn't going to discourage.
I had a father, until he finally made a dive in Buffalo, New York, New York, exactly on the other set of the borders of the border of the border of the border of the border, where we lived.
I gave a dive in a pool of the YMCA in the winter in Buffalo, New York.
Ozean, but a real Ozean, I first got two years later, I first got to face two years later, when we moved to C
Seiton, in the 40 years, which are inside, I've spent about three hours of water, I spent about 10,000 hours.
And I've learned that the world of deep sea, even in the float, even in the field, so ridiculous life is how we can really not imagine.
The Phanasy of nature doesn't know limits to our own, very much of our own, class human imagination.
I see what I see today today's days I see the deepest horse for what I see on the moment.
And my love to Ozean, with the same intensity, with the same intensity like eh and yourself.
When I looked at a major care, it was the filming, it was the filming.
That seemed the best mosquition to tell stories, stories, with my needs, with my needs, to make images.
When I was a child comicbooks and so.
So were movie of the Weg, and the stories and stories. The passenger.
Of course, the stories that I looked at the Sciences of Fiction, "Terminator," Terminator, "Aliens," and "Abyss."
I was able to the Abyss, I could make my preferences for the underwater water and the background.
So, my two period, my bottom.
Something happened to "Abyss," To, "To telling," To telling, we had to create a kind of liquid water, and we were created to create a kind of liquid water, CG, back.
And what came out was the first computer generated surbing Surfactor, who was in a film.
The film was not an opportunity, he was playing his product, he was a functioning, but I realized, I realized something that was like hypnotice: the audience that went out of the magic, who went out of it.
Look Arthur Clarke's law are familiar scientific technology and magic, not to distinct in a different way.
So they saw something magical.
And that's what I found is.
And I said, "Wow, this must be inconditional to the filming."
So we went to "Terminator," my next film, "my next movie, a lot of further.
So with ILM, we made up there, we made the guys of liquid metal, the success, and the success, the successfully about how this effect.
And it worked. Again, we had created something magical, and the effect in the audience was the same, and we've done with the movie, we've already played a bissue more opportunity.
From these two experiences of these experiencing, was a very new world of creating a whole new world of creation.
So, I started a company, I started a company, and I was a good friend Stan Winston, who was the best mace-Up-up and Creature-designer. She was called "Digital Digital Digital."
The reason this company of this company, it was to the phase analoger processes with optical printing and equipment and begin to begin with digital productions.
And that's what we did, and we created a contemplating a competition.
But the middle of the '90s, we realized that we were in the Character and character for us to get the fruit, for us to the Firma yellow.
I wrote this piece of "Avatar," which was the knife was in things visual effects, and computer generating effect and computer generating effects into new hoods, with registic human, expressive characters, and the major burning was all the Character to be the GDaracter.
But the knife was back to the very nice, and people in my company, and people in my company, I told that we don't yet to make it.
So I disappeared this, and made this other film about the big ship.
And that's what I was like, "Romeo and Julia on a ship." It became a lovely epic scale, a low-a-mazing movie.
But I was a conclude, I wanted to go to the real word of Titanic.
That's why I made the film.
That's the truth. The studio didn't know.
And I convincing them by saying, "We're looking at the wrack. We're going to make the real value.
We're going to show it in the public sequence.
That's uncomfortable. It's a good serious snail. "
And I discovered it to funding an expedition.
And that's crazy. But this goes back to that your own imagination can create a reality.
And we actually created six months later, a reality where I found myself in a Russian daughtments that I found myself in the surface of the surface of the Norblantic, and me the real Titanic through a bullue.
That was not a movie, no HD, that was real.
So, this really got me around.
And the preparation was enormous. We had to do cameras and the workers, and everything mds.
And I was like this deep sea very similarly similarly similarly similar.
Well, they were high-technically and representing planning.
You get into this chapse, you're going to go into this duncle, you walk into this third, where no hope on respect, if you don't make it back yourself.
And I think, "Wow, that's the same as I would be in a sentences of fiction movie.
That's real cool. "
I was regulated from the Earth's deep sea.
Anyway of the part that has to do with curiosity, and it was all. It was all. It was all of them, it was a curiosity.
And it was an experience that couldn't give me hollydrogen.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect, but I couldn't imagine what I could see outside of the window.
I've never heard of the following expeditions, and sometimes things I've never been looking at the targets, and sometimes things that I had never been looking at before, and sometimes things that were overwhelmed and for the sleeping to the squeeeze of the slightning.
So this was really thrown me, and I wanted more.
And so I met a little unusual decision.
After the success of Titanic "I told me," OK, I want to take a major as a filmmaker in hollysession, and it's going to be a while full of a while full of a field of research. "
And then we started planning these expeditions.
We went to the "Bismarck," and investigate them with robotic vehicles.
We taught back to the word of Titanic.
We took a robot that we built, which we had built a fiberglass.
Our intent was to go down and look at the inside of the ships of the ship, which was never done before.
No one was the way of the wracks of the Wracks, and you had no resources for it. So we developed the nonetheless.
So I'm sitting on the Deck of the Titanic, in a daughter, and see plants that I know that you can see these breaks here and I know that you know, the band I know that a band I know that you have the band there.
And I fly with a robotic vehicles through the same vehicle.
I think it was a consciousness, but my consciousness is within the vehicles.
It felt like I was physically within the ship of the ship wrap of the Titanesy.
That was the surrealest form of a dinesday vu, because before I ever experienced every single, I know what I've ever experienced at the same time, I knew what at the same time, because I was a month of the vehicle of the vehicle, because I was helping the film.
The Set was a set of the farm plans of the farming of the ship.
So this was a highly strange experience.
She made me of this telepresent experience of this teleprisoners that you use such robots like this, and so your own consciousness in the vatar, and so your own consciousness in this different shape of existence.
It was really unlikely to be deeply deeply professional profession.
And perhaps a little bit of what might happen in some decades, if you have cyborg characters to do something or other things, in all possible for the post-human-post-human-human-humanities that I can imagine as a Scienario.
And after this expeditions, we started to learn about what we really had to really established, for example, these deeply deep sea sources where we looked at these unbeliefs, but this is the outpledge, but here on Earth.
They're living with chemosynthesis.
They don't exist in a sunlight based on sunlight based on.
And so you can see animals that you can see a 500 degrees Celsius hot.
Wols live. And you can't imagine that they can survive.
I was interested in the same time, I was very interested in the woods, which was again, the Sciences of fiction influencing from my childhood.
And so I ended up with the people who are interested in the well-being, and the NASA SA sachievements, and the NASA Sachievements, and they drive to Russions, and they drive to Russions.
That was fascinating.
But the end of the end that I loved the woods that I was taking out with us in the deep sea.
I took them to and make them conversation to the world down there: astrobiologist, planetary, planetary path, people who were interested in these extremely situations, and I took them to the sources for these sources, and so on.
We turned out of the documentary founded, but eighborhoods, conceivable, functioning.
So, the circle between my existence as a scitizens of fiction fan, at the time, and the reality.
I learned a lot of this discovered discovered.
I've learned a lot about wealth, but I've learned a lot about leadership.
Now, you think, is a regular region, a regular leaders, a leader like a ship skapital or so.
But I didn't understand a lot of leadership before I was true this expeditions.
Because at a particular point I had to say, "What do I do here?
Why do I do this? What does it happen? "
Those bird of films don't get an opportunity.
We're playing the production of the product, and we're playing a track.
All think I was between "Titanic" and Avatar "and Avatar" and I would have walked me somewhere the cell on the beach.
I have all these movies, this documentary foot, for a very small audience.
No ruhm, no huge. What do you do?
You machine there's a totally wild, around the challenge -- and the Ozean is the most challenge of environment that there are. You're doing it, because you're doing it, and because of the strange, and because of the strange of people.
Because we did all of this with only 10 to 12 people who worked under the years, and we've been working uninvolved, and manmal, we were two to
And in this gemingly, you know the most important thing is the most important thing that you've got one, because you have a single instead of an arguments that you can't explain anyone.
If you go back to the land says, "We had to do it, the free glass, the fberglass, the smile of dumping, and the difficulty, the difficulty of the human sufficient, if you have sea, you can't explore the other way, you can't explore the other way.
It's a connection, a connection, a commercial respect.
So when I came to turn the next movie "Avatar," Avatar, "I tried to use the same leadership, you know the team, you know, you're respecting your team.
Dynamics was really changed.
So I stood again with a little team on unlikely on unbedded, and we turned "Avatar," with a new technology that was not yet.
Uncle.
It's an uncomfortable challenge.
And we've been for a period of time, for a huge filamiles.
So, my way, I changed my way to make movies.
There were people who said, we would have made these Ozeana wonderful way and on the planet Pandora.
For me, it was more a principle way, my job, the foreign process that changed in
So what can we go out of all of this?
How do we learn?
I think that's first, the curiosity is.
It's the most powerful human property.
Our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality.
And the option of your teams is more important than all of the Lorbeer of the world.
I get young filmmakers who say, "You give me a rat how I can do something like me."
And I said, "Sraise you don't know yourself.
That's a different for you. Don't throw yourself, won't throw against yourself. "
The NASA has such a favorite one: "Something is," Seir is not a sleep. "
But the art, in art and the early Earth has to be failed, because there's a conversation.
No important understanding, the innovation, the innovation was ever caught without risk.
You've got to be ready to take these risks.
That's the thought I'd like to give you to you with the Weg.
If I want to bring you today a thing is that the whole thing that we consume, the whole thing that we consume, larger than the sum of their indistribution and instead of individuals, I want you to think about how we can use information to think about how we can use information that patterns, and we don't know what we can't know the test, and representation.
So, what we see here is a typical starvbedded to old.
The program I use this is a little experiment.
It's called Pivents, and what I can do with piece is that I can film for a particular death, we're going to tell accidents.
And I can see another patterns, which is allowed.
And that's because in the middle of people are most active, and they are the most active, and they are the most active.
We can go out and go down a step on and see the data and see that circle disease and cancer are the region, but not for everybody.
Now, if we go to age, and we're going to see, we can see 40 years or younger, we can see that accidents should be making.
And who looked at whereas is that's especially in male.
So, you can see that the idea of information and data in this way, very swimming in a living information.
And if we do this for reward, why cannot do for content themselves?
What we now have the Title bilons of every single "Sports Illustred," which were ever printed.
It's all here. It's all online.
You can test it to my talk to you about my talk in your layers.
With Pivents can go into a decade.
You can introduce a year.
You can jump directly to a certain extra.
Now, when I look here, I see the athletes that seems that seems in this extra, and the sports.
I'm a lance of armstrong Fan, so I'm going to get out of all the extra in me of the lance of the armstage.
Now, if I just want to get a big foundly surprising, I could think "OK, what if I look at all with the topic bicycle?"
So I go back to a step back, and I'm going to take the view.
Now I see Greg Lemond.
And so, you get an idea of that if you look at this kind of information, they're more more more, they're decided, broadly, you're not just seeking or surgeon, you don't just or surfing.
You do something that's a little bit different.
It's something between, and we think it changes the way information can be used to use information.
I want to do this idea, I want to explore about what a bish crazy is crazy.
What we've done here is, we took every single Wikipedal, and reduced them to a little collaboration.
The collaboration is a short survival, and a symbol for the area, and a symbol for.
I'm just going to show the top 500 of the most popular Wikipedides.
But even in this one individuals, we can do a lot of things.
Sofort, we get a sense about the topulary of the issue that are the most popular.
I'm going to choose the government.
Now, after I chose government, I recognize that the Wikipediacy that the Wikipediacy, which are most with the Time of "are people of the year."
This is really important, because this is an insight that is not in a single Wikipediases.
It's just to recognize a step and look at the whole thing.
At on a certain of these collaboration, I can then go into the theme of Time, "people of the year," and all the way
Now, if I look at all these people's people who are the major government, I know that the majority of government.
And interestingly, Bono is a TED Prize winner.
And so we can jump and throw a look at all TED Prize winner.
You can see, we're going to be the first time it is really a network, not only is it's a network, not only from sea, but a lot of abstract.
And so I want to show you what a little bit of a surprise could be.
I'm just going to show you the New York Times website.
Pivents, this application -- I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser, but you can look at this -- and we bring this zoom-tech this zooms like this.
So I can go back to a step, and directly to a specific second.
That's important, because you can look at the slide of the websides in this kind of way, all of the Internet desire to the same way.
So, I can cut into a pleasure in a particular sign.
So here's the standard of the entire demanding that I've got to keep up until
And I can take some kind of what I've been looking at now now now, repeatedly back.
And if I look out a step out and look down and everything, I can take a single slice on my search past, I can retract a single training, here, I've walked to Labs.
And I can go into the snail, and put it again.
It's a metaphor that's going to be bigger than the sum makes the template bigger than the sum of the data.
In the moment, in this world, we think that there are a flight.
We're talking about the flight of the information.
We're talking about the "extent in information."
What if we could turn this situation, and the Internet on the head, so that we can always go from one to another, so instead of the things that we started to go to many things, and by patterns, and by patterns, and by patterns, and by pattention?
If we can do this, then, this bish will be a new source of data, maybe a new source of sources.
And instead of moving in information, we can get out of the information, we can get out of it.
And if we experienced knowledge, maybe we can actually go out of it.
And I hear, thank you very much.
Everyone talks about the game.
I've counted some people who are pleasure of the books that were published with "Happiness" in the Titel in the last five years, and they were going to get about 40, and there were much more.
There's a huge wave of the interesting of the interest.
There's a lot of globe coaching coaching.
Everybody would like to do happy.
But despite all of this flat from workers, there are multiple cognitive falls that are almost impossible to think about glock.
And my talk today is going to be hopeful by these cognitive falls.
That goes to Laia, who think about their own globe, and it goes to think about globe, and it goes to think about globe, because it turns out that we're going to be in the same way everybody else.
The first one of these falls is a contract to be completely.
It turns out that the word Glesson is not a useful word, because we use it too many different things.
I think there's a certain meaning that we could crushing it, but in the Great, and all of these things that we need to stay, and we're going to take the complete view of the complete view.
The second fall is a single case of experience and memory: essentially, it's basically in his life and happy about his life and happy about his life, or happy with his life.
And these are two very different concepts, and they were both in the idea of the globe.
And the third is the concentration of concentration, and this is the unhappy fact that we can't think about a conststitute that we can't think about a significant without detecting their meaning.
I mean, this is a real cognitive fall.
There's simply no way to get right.
Now, I'd like to start with one example of somebody who had a woman, who had a two-and-of-and-a-session, who was a told a story.
And then he added to, really clearly emotional, that has ruinated the whole experience.
But it didn't.
What it was ruined was the memories of the experience.
He had the experience of the experience.
He had had been honored by 20 minutes.
They didn't count, because he was walked with a memory, the memory, and the memory was ruined, and the memory was all what was going to do.
What this really tells us is that we could think about others and about others in the sense of two species of the self.
There's an experienced self in the present, and the present waiting, and the present, the present, but basically has only been the present.
It's this experiencing self that the doctor -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Well, right now?"
And then there's a remember self, and this remember is that, and that's the middle and the story of our lifetime, and it's your story, and it's your doctor, and it's your doctor, and it's the question, "How did you feel in the last time?"
or "How was your journey to Albania?" or something like this.
These are two very different unifying, the experience self and the remember, and the remember self, and the two is part of the Durchine is part of the Durchine.
Well, this remember self is a storyteller.
And that's really starting to be fundamental reaction on our memories -- it starts to do it.
We don't just tell stories, if we make stories of telling stories.
Our memory tells us stories, which means what we think of our experience is a story.
And let me take an example.
There's an old study.
These are real patients who are in a painful processure.
I'm not going to go into the detail. She's not painful, but she was painful, and she was painful when these study was done in the 1990s.
They were asked, all 60 seconds about their pain.
And here are two patients. These are their record.
And you're asked, "Who of both?"
And this is a very simple question.
Patient B has been definitely more, and a dimirrors was longer, and every minute of pain, who had patient had patient A, patient A, and more.
But now there's another question: "How much do these patients that they liked?"
And here's a surprise.
And the surprising is that patient was a much more bad memory had a much more bad memory, as a patient B.
The stories of the dimirrors were different, and because it's a very critical part of the story is how it ended.
And no one of these stories is very indeed or big -- but one of them is this definitely -- but one of them is definitely worse than the other.
And the worse is the worse, where the pain the end of his heavily on his head. It's a bad story.
Where do we know?
Because we asked these people to go to the dimirror, and also a lot later, "What was the whole thing in?"
And she was a lot of worse for A to remember for A.
Well, this is a direct conflict between the experience and the remember self.
For sentence of the experiencing self had B indeed a bad time.
Now, what you could do with patient A, and we've actually done clinical experiments, and it's been done, and it's worked, and it works, and it works, and it works, you could just longer the third reflection of patient A, and it's just without very much in their way.
That's going to leave that the patient, but only a bish and much as a bish and much as well.
And if you do this, you have a few minutes, you have a better story about your experience self of patient A worse, and you've got a better story of patient A much better, because now you have patient a much better story about your experience, because now you have a better story about your experience.
Wothrough a story?
And that's what the stories are the memory is that memory is, and it goes for the stories that we invent.
Wothrough a story of a story is extraordinary, significantly, meaningful message and ended.
Enden are very, very important, and in this case dominated the ende.
Well, this experience self alive.
It has been a moment of the experiencing one after the other.
And you ask: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is really easy. They're always lost for.
I mean, most of our lives -- and I have this extinct -- you know, the psychological present is, as you know, the psychological present, and what you know that there's about 60.,000, and what you know that there are about 60.
Most of them are ignored by the remember self.
And yet, you get the impression that they should count what happens is happening in this moment of the experience of the lifetime.
It's the limited resource that we are consuming in the world.
And how we would seem to be important, but that's not the story that remember is the story that remember is the story that remember.
So we have this remember self and the experiencing self, and they're really completely different
The biggest difference between them is the environment.
For sentence of the experiencing self, if you have a club, and the second week is extremely good as the first, then the two-wever is doubt.
That doesn't work for the remember, it doesn't work for the remember.
For that remember, a two-wever, is a two-white car, because no long-bycle, because no new rememories.
They haven't changed the story.
And that's what time is the critical variable, the critical variable, which has a remember of the self, is very little imposing influenced self on this story.
Now, that makes remember more than remember and stories.
It's a conclude, the decisions, because if you have a patients that are saying, because if you have a patients in two different surgeons in two different surgeons in two different surgeons, and that's the thing that's going to be the memory, and that's the memory, and that's the memory, and this is the way that the surrounded, and this is the surpris
The experiencing self has no voice in this election.
In fact, we don't choose between experiences, and we choose between memories.
And even if we think about the future, we don't think about our future.
We think about our future rememories for the predictable memory.
And basically, you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of remember self, and you can think of this remember self as one, and you can think of this, as a one of the way, that's bad self by experiencing the experiencing self needs.
I have the impression that if we do this is very broadly the case, that means we're doing this is called, we're doing smart, we're doing smart.
And this is a bubble hard to right, I think.
I mean, how much we return from our memories?
That's one of the explanations that remembers of the way to remember self.
And when I think about this, I think, I think of a couple of years ago in the Antarktis, who was the best practice I've ever had been thinking about it, and I think relatively often in the relatively often in the relationship.
And I've probably seen a memories of these three-week, I would say about about 25 minutes, I would say about 25 minutes.
Now, if I had opened the orders with the 600 images, I would have spent a little hour.
Well, these are three woods, and these are high-a-half hours.
There seems to be an intention.
Now, I like a bissue extremely, you know, how little appetition I have to the teaching of memory, but even if you have more of it, even if you give more of it, you have a real question. While we give up to the mind that we give up experiences?
So I want you to think about a thought-experiment.
Imagine your next club, you know that on the end of the original sults of all your images, and you get a nestic medication so that you're not going to remember.
Now, would you choose the same clothes? And if you would choose a different club, there's a conflict between your bottom, and you have to think about how you decide this conflict, and that's really surprisingly wouldn't be thinking of a conflict, because if you have a conflict of time.
Let's go out of the organ exercise we're looking for is a problem that asked us with a election between the two ways.
Well, they throw two words of the self of the whole thing.
There are actually two concepts of the Great that we can use, one per self.
So you can ask: How happy is this experiencing self
And then you wonder: How happy are the eyes of life in the lives of life?
And they're all -- Glessiness for exercise is a definitely complete process.
Which are the emotions that can be measured?
And we are now immediately, we are now immediately, to get a definitely good idea about the time.
If you ask after the Great, it's a very different thing.
That doesn't act about how happy a person.
It's about how happen or deployment, the person is when this person thinking about their lives.
Very different term.
Everybody who doesn't have these terms of conversation will be mapping the glacy, and I'm high to a lot of researchers about wealthy, the exploration of the globe.
The distinction between the globe of the experiencing self and the past of the remember self in the last few years, and now you're putting to the two separation.
The Gallup organization has been asked a worldwide in which more than half-million questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences, and there were other efforts in the rest. And there was other
In the last few years, we've catched to learn about the Great.
And the major lesson that we've learned is that they're really different.
You can know, how happy it's lives, and that really don't tend to be much about how happy he lives, and it's a lot about how happy it.
Just to give you an impression of the correlation, the correlation, the correlation is about .5.
What this means is that if you were met, and you would tell you, his father, you would say, oh, his father, how much would you know about his site?
Well, you would know something about his site, but there's a lot of uncertainty.
They have so much insecurity.
And if I saying that someone's eight in a scala of 10, you have a lot of insecure about how happy is with his experiencing self.
So the correlation is low.
We know something about what the happiness of the girls of the globe.
We know that opportunity is very important, goals are very important.
We know that Glesson to be pledge to be happy with people that we like to spend time, time we like to spend
There are other pleasure, but this is dominant.
So, if you do the Great the bottom of the self of the self, you want to do very different things.
The closing following of what I've heard here is that we should really not imagined, that we should not be imagined as a respect for well-being.
It's a completely different term.
Well, a little bit, a different reason we can't think about globe to think about globe, we can't look at the same thing, if we're living about life and when we're actually living.
So if you ask the simple question, how happy the people are in California, you're not going to get the correct.
If you ask this question you to think that people have to be happy when you think we have to live in Ohio.
And what happens is that if you think about life in California, you think about the difference between the California and other places, and this difference, we say in clima.
Now, it turns out that clima very important thing for the experience self is not very important for the self, and it's not even very important for the meaningful self, which are people are.
Now, because the nice self is responsible, you can go to the end -- some people could pull the end -- some people could pull California.
And it's kind of interesting to follow what happens to people who are looking for California in the hope of California.
Well, you know, you're not going to be happy.
We know that.
But one thing is going to happen. They're going to think they're happy, because when they think they're going to remember how horribly the weather in Ohio, and they're going to feel that they have been remember the right decision.
It's very difficult to think about well-influenced, and I hope, I have a sense of how hard it is.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Thank you.
Now, when we taught a few practically, you know, there's a single interesting result, it was a single interesting result, which came out of this gallery.
Is something that you can share with us, because you have a few minutes now?
Daniel Kahneman: Sich
I think the most interesting result that we have in the gallered enframe is a payment that we haven't had to find out.
We found that in the globe on the globe of the living self.
If we look at how feelings with the income.
And it turns out that under an income of 60.,000 dollars a year, and this is a very large scale of Amerian, and this is a very large scale of Amerian, about 60.,000, but it's a big representative patient.
CA: 60,000.
DK: 60,000.
60.,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy, and they are increasingly unhappy, yield they will be.
So we get a absolutely floating line.
I mean, I have gotten so fat lines.
What happens is obviously that opportunity is not an experiencing glock, but that's a safe to be a safe, and we can make it very, very clear, and we can do this event, very clear, very clear measure.
In the sense of the other self, the remember self, remember, you get a different story.
The more yellow you to deserve destiny.
It doesn't go for emotions.
CA: But Danny, in the entire American region is about life, freedom, freedom to gression.
If people take this profession, I mean it seems to put it all on the head, everything we believe in terms of tax politics and so on.
Is there a chance that the lovely locked that the land would make a professional, and how the seriously containing.
DK: You know, I think there's a recognition for the role of the Great research.
The recognition will be slowly in the United States, no question, but in the United Kingdom, it's been happening and in other countries.
People are starting to think that they should think they should be thinking about globe, when they remember.
It's going to take a while, and people are going to discussion if they want to be discussion to experience, so we need to explore this discussion, so we need to explore this discussion.
As you can get a very different way to you think about how you think and if you think, and whether you think about this, and if you think about the remember.
It's a confuses influenced, I think, in the commendous years.
In the United States, you're looking at the experience of the experiences of the pop
That's going to be, I think, in the next one or two decades of the most decades.
CA: Well, it seems to me, this issue was the most interesting political delivered in the next few years.
Thank you very much for the invention of behavior.
Thank you. Thank you.
Today I'm talking to you about energy and clima clima
And that might be surprised something, because my full of time, my full of time, the paper, the things that we have to find and functional, and tells us to find and floating things that we have to make and flowing the poorest two billion a better life.
But energy and clima clima are extremely important for these people, extremely important for every other on the planet.
Climate means that their saying that their seats are not going to be growing over many years, and we're talking about too much or little, and the things will not be able to change as it can't be able.
That leads to hunch. It leads to insure. It leads to insults.
So, a climate change will be terrible for them.
And also, the energy is very important for them.
In fact, if you could only reduce you could be the price of the price, to the arming desire, to the arming desire to the most effective.
Now, the energy is fall over time.
In fact, the progress society is based on energy exploring.
The carbon evolution, the industrial Revolution, and yourself in the 20th decade, there was a rapidly fall in the electricity, and that we have refrigerators, climate anlawyers, climate, and so many things do so many things.
So, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.
But if we're walking the price -- let's take the price -- let's make the price -- we meet on a new barrier and these barrier and these barrier with CO2.
CO2 is driving the planet and the equation for CO2 is eighborhoods.
They're singing the extinct CO2, which leads to temperature, and this temperature, and this temperature has a very newspaper, and maybe worse,
Now, the exactly actly between a CO2 feeling, and the daytemperature changes, and the resulting temperature changes and where their floor, there's some disclarity, but not very many.
And there are sure inklarity about how bad these fools are, but they're going to be extremely slim!
I asked the top-shaper multiple meaning, "Do we really get out of it.
Please don't have the heads or a quarter? "
The answer is: Let's come up, we're going to get zero, the temperature will continue.
So it's a big challenge.
It's very different than saying, we have a 3.5 feet, who has to hold a three-feet, and then you can sit down.
This has to go down here, on zero.
Now, we have a conversation of carbon dioxide, over 26 billion tons.
Everyone's about 20 tons. People from poor countries, usually, using a lot of countries, use as a.
In the average, it's about five tons for everyone on the planet.
And somehow we need to make changes that require this one.
It's constant constant.
Only economic changes have translated, and we need to confront of rapidly, and we need to go from rapidly to release in zero.
This equation has factors, a bish multiplication, and they have this thing on CO2, the thing on the left -- that's what you want to get from the antiplication of people in the average of the average of people in the average of the average of energy and every single energy for every single energy.
So let's look at every factor, and we translate how we get it to zero.
And probably, one of these numbers have to get zero.
Now this is basic algebra, but we go through it.
We have the population.
Today, 6.8 billion people live.
And it's writing to nine billions.
If we're very successful with new vaccine, the health concept and reprocesses of medicine, we might think about 10 percent to 15 percent, but at the time we see a 1.3.
The second factor are the service we use.
It's all the things that we have food, clothing that we have, clothing, clothing.
These are very good things and poverty reduction, these services almost every one on the planet.
It's amazing that this number is true.
In the rich world, in the top billions, we could make sure, and we could use, but in the average, that's the average, and it's a double doubling, and doubling them, the most doubling the services of the person.
Here we see a very fundamental service. Is there to read the house, so you can read the house?
And these students don't have it, so they walk out and read their schools under the street.
Now, in effectivity, the energy per service, there's good news.
We don't have something that's not worried.
By different successful in light, through other Autotypes, through other Autotypes, by new methods in the homes, there's a lot of service that you can dramatically beat, dramatically, dramatically, 100,000, there's 50,000: 50s, it's a lot of 350,000: 50s are de-percent.
Some one service is going to reduce 90 percent.
In other services, like the manufacture, 105, 105, 105: 56,000 -- 588,000 -- 588,000 -- 588,000 or the air traffic, is the game is the game for improvements very much smaller.
In fact, if we are optimistic, we might get a reduction to a factor, we might get a factor to 6th.
But in the first three factors, we have now taken away from 26 billion ton, maybe 13 billion tons, and that's not enough.
So let's take the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that's the amount of CO2, which is going to be emitted.
It turns out if you can get it to zero.
If you burn, no.
If you burn gas burning: No
Almost every manufactures for electricity today CO2, CO2, except the renewable energy and nuclear
So, what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system.
We need energy.
If I use the term "wonder," I don't mean the impossible.
The microprocessor is a miracle. The PC is a miracle.
The Internet, and that's a wonder.
People here have been trained to many of these wonder.
There are no delivering deadline that you needed a wonder to a particular data.
You know, you're going to be thoughtful, and some others don't.
In this case, we need to give bird gas and get a wonder in a very short time.
Now, I asked me, how can I really surprised it?
Is there a natural implications, a demonstration, the idea of the people here?
I remember last year when I was brought mosquitos and liked some kind of people.
The idea was really been for them, you know that there are people who live with mosquitos.
So for energy, this one.
I decided that the freedom would be my same year's going to be the same year.
So here are some natural girls.
You know, they're not going to leave them. In fact, they're not going to leave the glas.
Well, there are all kinds of game recipe solutions like this, but they don't bring a lot.
We need to take solutions, either one or multiple, or multimate, and unprevent relationship, and even though there are many of research, and even though there are a lot of research.
I've shown Geothermal, fusion and biocracies.
These are perfectly contributed, and if they have better than I was expected, that would be great, but my causes here is that we need to work on all of them, and we can't give them to them, because they have significant problems.
Let's look at first at the fossil fuels of fossil fuels, burning from either coal or earthquake.
What you have to do is, maybe just, but it's not, you have to do all the CO2, which is, after the burning, and then you have to claims, under pressure, and then you hope it's going to stay and hoping it there.
There are some pilotly projects that are going to be in a 60 percent, but it's going to get very difficult, but it's going to be very difficult, and a region for the CO2 to be a big challenge, is a challenge.
Who is it safe?
Who can garantee something that literally many billis more than any kind of billion than any kind of billion, and other things?
That's a lot of people.
So this is a hard nuss.
The next thing: Nuketry.
It also has three big problems. The cost, especially in highly regulated countries, and the question for security that you can really feel that nothing wrong, despite the human cops is not for weapons.
And what do you do with the waste?
Because, even though he's not very big, there's a lot of remember.
People need to feel good at this. 184: 10: 20,000 -- 20,000 -- 10: 25,000 so, three very difficult problems that might be solve solvable to solve solve problems that are solvable to solve.
So, three very difficult problems that are solving solvable, and that you should be working on.
The last three of the five, I was totally flowing.
It's the renewable energy, as often as they are called.
And they have -- although it's great is that they don't need a fuel -- they have some departs.
To one is the energized that these technologies are dramatically locally locked dramatically.
These are disease, you're talking about a lot of square atiles, thousands of squares, thousand times more surface than a normal force.
And also, these sources are these sources.
The Sun doesn't seems all day, she doesn't seem to the day, and it doesn't seem to the wind.
So, you have to have to get from these sources, if you don't have a wear that's energy in times when you don't have to get action.
So there's big price here, and there are challenges in transmission, and there are challenges at the time we say that the energy source is not just the energy source outside of the country, you don't just need to go with the risk, you need to go with the risk of where the risk of where the energy comes from where different.
And there's a campaign problem.
And to show the dimension, I have all the kinds of batteries that are made of the batteria, competition, the cell phones, cell phones, for everything, and this is what I've been invited with the electronic energy, which I found that all the batteries of the world, and I found that all the batteries of the batteries of the world,
So, we need a big breakthrough here, something that's going to be a factor of 100 better than the character of 100 better than the character.
It's not impossible, but it's not so easy.
That happens when you tried to get these both sources, we say 20 percent of the consumer sources
If you want to stop 100 percent of it, you need to have a unbelievable wonderful battery.
Now, where are we going to go: What is the right approach?
A "Manhattan project? How do we get to the goal?
What we need is many companies are working on it. Hundreds.
In each one of these five areas we need at least 100 people.
You'll say, they're crazy, they're crazy! That's good.
I think here in the TED group, there are many that already existed.
Bill Goss has multiple companies, under another called eSolar thermal technologies.
Vinath Khosla invested of dozen companies are touching the great things and interesting multimate mons and I try to support it.
For example, Myhrvold, and I funded a company, which is perhaps the nuclear approach.
There are some innovation in the nuclear, modular, liquid.
The development in this industry has stopped some time, so it's not a big surprising that some good concepts.
The terribly concept meaning that you instead of a circle of the U235, we decided to use 99 percent, we decided to use 99 percent, the U238.
That's a single crazy idea.
But in fact, you had thought about it, but you couldn't be able to simulate whether it's worked, whether it's been modern supercomputers, you can simply see, and you can see: Yeah!
And because you spend this 99 percent, the cost-profile profile much better.
In fact, you're burning the waste, and you can even use the waste of the reactors as a tritrial.
Instead of breaking on the head, burning it just. A great thing.
The Uran will use graph, a bish like a candle.
You can see that it's a kind of mammals, often as "Well Reactor."
It really solves the greatest problem.
So here's a bild of a place in Kentucky.
That's the waste, the 99 percent, and you've got the part that's called the part that's taken up to it.
That tribe the U.S. for hundreds of years.
And if you drive Ozeanwater and just flowing, you get to the very location of the planet.
You know, there's a lot of challenges, but it's an example of a lot of concepts that we need to get prevent.
Let's take our success of success.
How should we look at our stuff?
Well, we go to the goal that we need to do and then we talk about the tops.
Many talk about 80 percent reduction reduction by 2050.
It's really important that we've got to get there.
The rest of 20 percent will be generated in poor countries, and even a little agriculture, hopefully, that is going to be clear and cement until it.
So to create this 80 percent, the industries need to industries, including countries like China, their electricity generation.
The other nights says, if we put the zero emissions of technology, whether they're put in all the developed countries, and we're on the Weg, and we
That's a super-important.
This is going to be a key of stuff.
If we go from there, how should the 2020 stuff?
It should be the two elements.
We should use the effectivity of effectivity to bring reduction on the way, and we're emitting, the lower is going to be the carbon will be the carbon is going to be the carbon.
But, this nevertheless is this notes for the things that we don't lead to the large reductions, just the same, or even something more important like the other, which is the other, which is the clothes of the innovation for these diamount.
And this breakthroughs, we have to cut with Vollgas, and we can measure, in the case of piloting, in the piloting projects and regulation changes.
There are many great books to this issue.
The Al Gore book, "We have the Wahl" and David McKays, "Suginable Enery Without the Helandlesson Air."
They're going to go through and create a framework where this can be discussed, because we need to use it, and we need to use it to support it.
There's a lot of them, they have to calculate.
That's a wish.
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
If you just put a wish for the next 50 years, I could choose the practice, a vaccine, and that I love, or I could choose this wish, or I could choose this wish, and I love this wish.
Dieser has the largest impact.
If we don't get that wish, the reason is going to be horrifying between the long-terly people, between the USA and China, between the USA and China, between poor countries and almost all of this life.
So what do we need to do?
For what curious action is I?
We need to put in more research for more research.
If countries in places like copped copping, they should not be talking about CO2.
You should have to prevent this innovation strategy, and you swallowed from the ridiculous journey for these innovation.
We need market, CO2 taxes, Cap, Cap & amp; trade something that is a price signal.
We need to describe the message.
We need to have dialogue rational and complete things that are taken from the government.
It's an important wish, but I think we can fill it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Just to understand terrate something better -- first, you can give us an idea of the scale of this investment?
Bill Gates: To to make the simulation on a supercomputer, all the large piece of session, what we've done, only 10 million, and even if we tested our materials in a Russian reactor to make sure that it works are only involved in the 1000-million.
The difficult step is the blue of the first reactor to find another billion, to find the regularia, and the place that's the first one.
Only the first thing is done when it walks as floor, it's all quite clear, it's all clear, because the amazing thing is as different than at nuclear energy, as we know.
CA: To to understand this really: That means that deeply in the ground like a vertical source of nuclear browd, and then starts to the process of the process, and then the process of the process?
BG: Right. You have to fill the reactor always to fill the reactor, so there are many controlling, and a lot of controlling it, and it's not good. That's not
But if you have very cheap, you can fill it for for 60 years -- think of a bunch -- you think of a bunch -- you think of a bunch -- you think of a bunch of all the time.
And it sits there and burned 60 years, and then it's finished.
CA: A nuclear reactor, which is a solution for the trash.
BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the trash: You can sit -- there's a lot of waste -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it into the next reactor and burn it.
And we started taking the trash, which is already existed in these refrigerators or drinking dry, or dry. That's our star burden. That's our Startors.
So, this is what these reactors was a problem that we fill in our fill, and so that's going to be reduced dramatically during this process.
CA: But while you've talked about these moments in this world about these moments.
So where is the biggest interest, what really do?
BG: Well, we haven't totally flowing on a lot of interesting open-legal regularly for everything the nuclear car. There's an interest, and there's an interest and the people were in Russia, India -- I was here and I've been talking about it.
I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have made something in the rest.
This is a varian one thing that was done.
That's a big step forward, but it's like a faster reactor and some countries have built, and some countries have built, and there's a quickly for our first.
CA: In your imagination: Sweeks and probability so to run something like this?
BG: Well, we need one of these scalable, stromgenerating things that are very indeed, we have 20 years to find, and then 20 years to replaces.
This is the Deadline that showed us the environmental models that we have to hold.
And, you know, training, if anything walks, and this is a big wish, and it's a big wish, it could be easy.
And happy, there are dozens of companies, and we need hundreds that, when their approach works that can work for their pilots of practice for their pilots.
And it would be the best, if it could make multiple more, you could use a mixture.
We need a solution. We need a solution.
CA: Betreffing of the big paper, this is the site of the big, is this the site you know?
BG: An energy through is the most important thing.
That would be it without the environment, but it's so much more important.
There are other innovation, there are other innovative companies.
You know, we don't know what this work is, but there are the modulary method, that's another approach.
There's a liquid reactive reactor, which seems seems to us.
And so there's different, but the beautiful about this is that a Uranmolecule has a millimmal, as a, we say, a carbon molecule, and so if you can go with the problems, and these are the cost and the costs that are the potential, the rest, and the costs that are the potential, and the impress, and the p
CA: If that doesn't work, what?
Do we have taken not-falling, to try to keep the earthquake temperature?
BG: If you get into this situation, it's when you get too much, and short before you get too much, and then you might have a heart attack. What do you might take a heart attack or something.
There's a research of research, which is called Geoengineering with different techniques, to cut up with different techniques, so that we're taking 20 or 30 years longer.
That's just a insurance.
You don't hope we don't need to do it.
More people say, you don't know about the insurance, because you know, you know, you know, you know, because you know that you're going to be a heart claim.
I don't know whether that's smart, if you have the importance of this problems in front of this problems, but there's now a disease in Geoengineering about whether you should have to get the things faster, or that innovation needs longer than we expect.
CA: Climasceptic: Are you or two sentences for you to convince you?
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics in very different camps.
Those of those who are doing some of the arguments, are very little.
Do you say, there's negative effects that have to do with the clouds that things?
There are very, very few things that they can tell them, and they can say that there's a chance in a millions.
The major problem here is as similarly like AIDS.
You do the mistake, and you're inside, you know, and you're going to be a lot later.
And that's why, if you have all kinds of drining problems, in something that you've got to invest in something that you've got, what the investment is not so clear, the investment is not so clear, the ICC
The fact is that this insecurity should make us feel.
But my dream here is that if you can do it economic, and at the same time, the CO2, and at the same time, the skeptics: "OK, it's not a CO2, I wounded me that it's not a CO2, but I'll be acceptable to accept it, because it's been cheating."
CA: And that would be your Antword on the kinds of Lomborg argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the CO2 problem, all the other goals unfortunately, the poverty of malaria and so on that there's things that are going to do this.
BG: Well, the actual extra for the research -- we tell the U.S.. 10 billion per year than they do today -- that's not so dramatic.
There are not supposed to suffer.
You get to the big money, and you can remember, and you can remember something that's not economic, and it's not economic, and tried to funding that.
It's because, you're very quickly before a cost-roke and funded only a learning short, and I think we should try to have more things that the potential to be much more likely.
If the abstract you get, a very high energy, very high energy, then only can crush the series.
I mean, everybody from us here could spend five times for our energy without change without changing his lifestyle.
For those two billion, but it's a disaster.
And even Lomborg thinking.
His new mass now, "Where's not going to be a research?"
It's still going to be, because of his earlier stories, with the skeptic champ, but he has been constantly constantly, and it's why it's a very single group and so now he's now now now the research argument.
And this is a thought I have asked that I have asked.
The research, it's just crazy, how little the support is.
CA: Bill, I think I'm talking for almost all of the people here, when I say, I really hope your wish. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
BG: Thank you.
I'd like to tell you something something about a few months ago in a few months ago for Italian Wired.
I've always write my synonym-dictionary, but I was at the field of the text, but I was at the field, and I fell in my life, what the word "really meant."
I read you to the practice.
"Adjumption," Adjustify, destroyed, destroyed, destroyed, destroyed, destroyed, browded, broken, bad, broken out, bad, broken, bad, shaped.
Antonymous: After, strong, strong. "
I remember this list of a friend and had to laugh, it was so ridiculous, but I was just until "and couldn't have to read to read and read me and read me and read me to this.
Of course, this was a thousand, old synonym-dictionary. I just thought that the extra, and I just thought that the extra.
But in fact, it was a single train the early '80s, when I was just started with the basic journey, and I started to build my familiar outside of my familiar confields and forms to the world around me.
And God was at the time, thank you very much at the time.
If I was born this puts seriously, I was born in a world that would be able to take a person who could be able to be itially idential, but today I'm going to be a chance and adventures that I've experienced.
So I immediately wounded in 2009, and expected that I find a speech of 2009, and I find a speaking.
Here's the actualized version of this one.
It's not much better.
In particular, the last words, the last words, the last words "Near Antonymous."
But it's not just about the words.
It's about what we think about the people that we described with these words.
It's about the values that are in these words, and how we construct this values.
Our language, our thinking, and how we see the world and how we see the world and the people around us.
Many old old soil creates, including the Greek and the resolution, really believe that the area has a big force of an average, because what you can be saying is a big force, because what you can do is that manifest.
So, what do we want to manifest -- a limited people or a powerful people?
Already a people who have either either as a child, could crushed them and contributing them and conceive them.
Wouldn't it be beautiful to you doors?
A human who opened up to door Turns on the A.I. I. Delair in Wilmington in Wilmington in Delair.
It's called Dr. Pizzlo. A Itangio-American, who name like you can think most of the amount of Amerian. So he was always called Dr. P.
And Dr. Pth was always a very bunte flies, and it was just made for the work with kids.
I found the time that I spent in this hospital, just great -- until my physical therapy.
I had to seemingly often seemingly infinitely often repeatedly, changing in different colors -- in different colors -- that you know, to look at my bein-muscles, and I hate these balls of the more than anything else. I hate them.
And imagine, I have even more than five year-old kid with Dr. P.
And one day, he was watched me at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just ended, and he said to me, "Wow, Aimee, you're so strong, powerful and young girls, you're going to cut a date, you're going to cut up.
And if you can do it, I give you a hundreds. "
This was a very simple trick of Dr. P. I do not make the exercise that I didn't want to do with the extent, that richest five years of become hospital girls in the hospital girls in the hospital, and he actually got me to look at new horror.
And I ask today, how very vision of my vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl, and I could imagine, and I could imagine as a nature of strong, powerful and attaching attachment and attached to see powerful and at
That's just one example of many, like earlier machine can regularity of a child.
But as the only one of these examples from the synonym-dictionaries, make our language don't have a space to imagine what we would want to think about: what we would like to see: what we would all woke us to see yourself as a powerful way to see people.
Our language, our software changing in many cases that have been solved in many cases by technology change.
Vom medical standpoint, you can say that my legs, the natural surgeon, the laser surgery for vision, challenge of Titan and artificial housing of Titan and artificial circumstances of their moments, in their own lives, to use their moleculations and their ments are actually insivations, to their
And so what we've been to group to groups, they're searching themselves.
So, perhaps this technology changes, because the young that there was always a different truth, there was always a different truth, that every person of society can give something very special, and that the human ability to adapt, and that the human ability to adapted, our biggest.
The human skills to pass -- this is an interesting story, because people are going to tell me about how I would please to tell you what I'm going to do with desire and I'll be given to you: Dieser sentences for me and I'm going to say, and I think about it, and I think I'm going to say, and I think I'm going to tell you about, and answer
Dieser sentence from the environment that successful or game of this idea that successful or a challenge of this idea that successful, without being conversation, because when my life would be so successful, because I would have been so succcessful of a life with a lifessions of a.
But the truth is that we change. Of course, we're prepared from the challenge, whether it's physically or emotional or even the bottom is emotional or even of the bottom is that we are.
And I hold that this is good.
Widrities are not a obstacle that we need to reveal with our lives.
Widrities easy to our lives.
And I tend to see what we do is seeing a shadow.
I notice realize he's very present, sometimes it's not to see, but he's complete.
And I don't want to do anyone to the effect of the fight, the shame of a human.
There are lives in life and challenges, and they're only to be allocation and every person is going to be different, but the question is not whether we get to the question, or not, but as we get to it.
So we're not just responsible for it, people that we love, people we love to prevent sheets in front of sheet, but they also report to it well.
And we don't get our kids, if we give them a feeling that they cannot adapt.
You've got to separate two things: to a medical fact, to be amplaced and to the other healthy the societal opinion about whether I'm introducing or not.
And to be honestly, the only real and low-level disability, which I had to put out, is that the world conditioning, it can described me with this definition.
In our wish, the people who are to protecting us the heart and the cold, hard them, hard truth about their medical prognosis, or even a prognose to quality of life that they're not expecting, we have to adapted that we don't have the fundamental for it.
Maybe the momental concept that is just on what's in a bigger, and how we repair that, for every single one, and how we repair a bigger disability as the Pathology.
If we don't treat a human entirely, and not all of his crowd and molds of their crowd and recognize, we can also get to the natural button that might lead, one more disease.
We degrade a people who has a society value.
So we need to look at the patology, and focus on all the area of human molds.
But the most important important, is that there are between the perception of our individuals and our great invention, and our great invention invention.
We should not be able to reveal these times or detecting, we should not try to reveal them, we should not try them, but it's about to see them under the paper, but it's about to recognize the world.
It may be more to me to make sure that we need to calculate wonders that we need to overcome, but that we're open to it, and we're open to the sleeping them on the sleeping expression, and perhaps it.
And maybe we create it, desire to see the various, and useful and useful and useful, and feeling us so through their practice.
In this year, we celebrate the 200 birthday of Charles Darwin, and when he wrote 150 years ago, Darwin, in my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyes, in my eyes, in a human character.
I would write it so: No, the most powerful of his way, and not the intelligent of his kind of, but the intelligence of his kind of, but the way to adapt changes.
Aus conflict is created creature.
No, just out of Darwin Werk, we know that the skills of the people, to survive and remained by conflict of human mind.
So, again, change, change and adaptation are the great capacity of the people.
And maybe we know, we know, we're celebrated, if we're really prison.
People are exactly the point of wind is the sense of Widrities, a perception of the ix, a sense of our own force.
We can introduce ourselves.
We can give a new meaning of a new meaning that goes across slightly over the shapes.
Maybe we can see the desire of change as a change.
Widrities, for a change that we have no leverage that we have not yet.
I think the biggest damage that we have to be able to believe that we should be normal.
Mall, who is normal?
There's no core.
There's the extraordinary. The guy. And you wouldn't get the corners. And would you really want to learn this poor, because they really want to learn?
I don't think.
It would be great, if we can free this patterns of the normality or the strength, or the strength, to share it even an amazing, and so we could free the crowd of the notes of very many children, and they invite them to make their own specific and completely.
Anthropols have been decided that we have people from the members of our society is a contributed to be a contribution: useful and contribution.
There are evidence that already the Neanderthals in front of 60.,000 years ago, and people have been smart disorders, and that's what happened to happen to society, and that's what happened to society was worth about.
They don't have these people who were looking at, and they were looking at the way, they were treated as something special and well-being.
I went to the city that I was growing up in the city that I grew up, in a food market in the Nordosting of Penna sylvania, and I stood there's a bedroom.
It was summer, and I had Shorts.
And I hear, like a guy behind me, "Well, if not Aimee Mulls."
And I turned around and I turn these older man. I had no idea who he is.
And I met "Sir, we know? I can't remember you."
And he said, "Well, you don't remember me.
When I first saw you, I walked you out of your mother. "
Oh, so the one.
And naturally it did it click.
That was Dr. Kean, a man that I just knew that I knew from my mother was about this day, because I naturally key to my birthday to my birthday.
The doctor for prisoners of my mother was in the club, and so my parents, and so my parents who brought me to the world, overcome.
And because I was born without a wonderful, and my feet had been flowing, and I just had a few toes on this, and a few toes on this, he had to take the surprise, he had to take the word news.
He said to me, "I had to tell you that you would never walk, and never walk, and never move his worth like other kids or you could never leave a unable life, or you've never walked me, you've just wrap."
I was extraordinary, I found that he was taken pleasure of my entire childhood, no matter whether I had been in a letter of the two-class competition in the second classroom, whether I had won the path of the parent of the parade of the parent, or my shapes, or my shaping.
And he called this part of his curses the X factor, the potential of the human willing.
You can't be able to affect how critical this factor can be the quality of life can be.
And Dr. Kean told, he said, "I learned that kids, if they don't get anything else, and even if they don't get a slightly different, and even if you get kids can get a lot of yourself, you can get a lot."
Look, Dr. Kean has changed his thinking.
He had stances that the medical diagnosis, and they've been around, two different things are.
And also I had changed my thinking in the layer of time, when they wasked me in the age of 15 years, whether I would have wondered against legs and bones, then I wouldn't have a second.
I was going to normally normally.
If you ask me this today, I'm not so sure.
And this is what happened, WEIL I experienced with my legs and not TROTZ of this experience.
And perhaps this change, because I've been involved so many people who have opened me to doors, who have been instead of instead of people who wanted to make me a imagination.
Look, it really needs just one people who demonstrated you can demonstrated your crumbs, and you are.
If you make it possible for somebody to activate your own, inner crowds -- the human mind is so sensitive -- if you create it, and for somebody in a critical moment -- if you create it, and for someone in a decision, you're a very good teacher.
They put them in yourself to open up yourself.
The Great Great Consil meaning in the word "education."
It means something prevent that in one is to cut out in one is to cut out.
Nochmals: Welern potential wants to make it?
In the '60s, in the 1960s, in Great Britain, and there was a gymnasia in total schools.
They call it "Streaming Trials," in the USA, we call this "tracking."
The students are divided.
And the A students are going to be more smart, the better teacher, the better teacher.
They then have a three-monatic space students with a three-month, "Note" Great, "Great," It was total, "they've been smart writing, they have written very smart.
And naturally, it's a heart that the heart of a heart of the solute students, she was seither just traveling.
And the same thing it was after the three months.
But just the ones who were still in the shoes -- above from the students who were smart.
That's what this study was that the teacher was that the teachers were not professed.
The teachers didn't know that something was changed.
They were just campaign that the solute students, and that the students are training with the novers, and it's been taught to them something and
The only effectively accessible is is a broken mind, who was broken, who was broken, no more beautiful. It's nothing.
But if we create it, to support the human mind to hope, to hoping themselves and other people to find himself and others to find curious and physically, we actually put our car and phantoilet's be really possible.
If a mind of these qualities, we can create a new reality, we can create a new reality and new dasine forms.

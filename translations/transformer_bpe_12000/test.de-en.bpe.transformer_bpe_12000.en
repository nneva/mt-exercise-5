A few years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman made a design competition called the Marshmallow challenge .
The idea is pretty simple . fourths have to have the size of voluntary structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1feet and a marshmallow .
The marshmallow needs to be up .
And , even though it &apos;s really simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s very , very , very quickly .
And so I thought this was an interesting idea , and I turned it into a design Workshop .
It was a huge success .
Since then , I did about 70 Workshops in the world , with students , developers and architects , even with CTOs of the Fortune 50-businesses , and there &apos;s something that enables in nature collaboration , and I want to share some of these with you .
But most of the people are actually beginning to do .
They &apos;re talking about what it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to harsh power .
Then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization .
They &apos;re investing a lot of their time in the structure .
And finally , just before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and they put it on the top , one step back and &quot; Ta-da ! &quot; Ta-da ! &quot; Ta-da ! &quot;
But then , almost always happens , it &apos;s that &quot; ta-da to a &quot; Oh , &quot; because the weight of the Marshall &quot; because the weight of the marshmallows that the whole thing is coming and down .
There are a series of people who have a lot more &quot; Oh a few moments than other people , and under the worst are fresh fresh bullets .
They lie , they &apos;re puzzling , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re really making a tiny bit of them .
And of course , there &apos;s also teams that have a lot more &quot; tails that have a lot more .
And that &apos;s pretty amazing .
As we told Peter , she didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
What they may be asking is , how does that come ? Why ?
And Peter said , &quot; No one of the children invested time in the head of Spaghetti GmbH . &quot;
They &apos;re not investing time in power .
There &apos;s another reason .
And it is that BL students were trained to find the right plan to find a real plan ,
And then you realize it .
What happens when they put the marshmallow on the top , they don &apos;t have time and what ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
All right ?
What is the children are different , they &apos;re going to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , and with the marshmallow , so they &apos;re going to do multiple possible prototypes .
Construcies recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of an iterative process .
And with every attempt to every attempt , which doesn &apos;t work .
That &apos;s how the performance is working with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
The average for most of most of the time , the average students create half of them , lawyers have a little bit more , but not much , children are better than the adults .
Who is the most successful ?
Architects and engineers , fortunately .
It &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve seen .
And why ? Because they understand triangles and safe self-sustain of geometric patterns are the keys to build .
CEOs are about average . But here it &apos;s going to be interesting .
You see an executive adrator on the team , they &apos;ll be meaningful .
It &apos;s incredibly . You can
You can predict the prediction . Why is this ?
Because they have special skills of processes .
They lead the process , they understand it .
And that team , which
Especialized skills and processes and the combination of success .
If you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , you have about six , the stable structure .
I tried a little bit more exciting .
I thought we get the Pokerin the same way .
So I offered a thousand dollars for software to the winner .
What happened with these design students ?
What was this result ?
This happened here . Not a team had a stable structure .
If there had been a half-inch construction construction , it would have been carried at home .
So is it not interesting that high wetled a strong effect ?
We repeated this exercise with the same students .
Now , what &apos;s happened ?
Now you understand the advantage of the prototyping .
That &apos;s the same , a bad team was the best .
They produced the highest construction construction in the lowest time .
And so there &apos;s a profound lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
You may ask , why would someone actually invest a marshmallow Challenge ?
The reason I &apos;m going to create digital tools and processes to help teams teams teams , to help teams teams teams , cars , video games and visuals .
And what the Marshall Challenge is to identify it helps to identify them hidden assumptions .
Because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
The challenge is to build a common experience of building language , building the right prototype .
And this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
And those of you who are interested in being able to go to the smartphone .
It &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallows .
There &apos;s a paceful step step in there .
They find crazy examples of the world , like people optimize the system and ensure .
There are also space corners .
And the whole thing , I think is , the construction is actually a connection with sports .
It turns out that all of our senses on the task , and that we &apos;re using our thinking about , how our emotions and our activity , in the challenge that &apos;s before us .
And sometimes a little prototype of this experience , everything that takes us from a &quot; uh-oh -- to a &quot; ta-&quot; moment .
And this can make a big difference .
Thank you .
Let &apos;s do it as we have a machine .
It &apos;s a big machine , TED machine , TED machine , and this is a time machine .
And everybody in this room has to be in this room .
And you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here .
And I wonder what you would choose , because I used to ask my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
I don &apos;t know that . They wanted to
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m confident that you &apos;re kind of moved to Nostalgy .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of this group , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to the past , and that &apos;s not because I &apos;m an adventures .
It &apos;s because the opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
So I want to go into this machine , and I want to go to the future .
This is the greatest time that there has ever been on the planet , no matter what scale you put : health , wealth , mobilitating , mobility , goes down disease .
There was never a time before a time .
My great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
My grandparents posted this number on 700s .
My parents are in the distance .
So there should be a nine at the beginning of my death rate .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
A child today is born in New Delhi is born as long as the richest man on the world &apos;s richest man on 100 years ago .
Think about it . That &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is that ?
The smallpox , billions have killed people on this planet .
You have new demographics of the Earth in a way that
They &apos;re gone . They disappeared .
We &apos;ve been doing it . Puff .
In the rich world , there are diseases that have been threatened by us just a generation .
Dipha , tube , child paralysis ...
Anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success of the scientific method .
And from my point of view , is the scientific method
So this is the good news .
Unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
And one of them is that , despite all of our achievements have a billion people to go to bed bed .
That number goes up , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s compromising .
And not just that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to manage this world .
Trinkicked in water , rainforests , oil , gas : They disappear , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t disappear from this chaos disdisappear .
So the question is : Can we do this ? I think .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that &apos;s going to feed billions of people without the country where they live on .
I think we can provide this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destroy it at the same time .
I really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a weak thought .
But this keeps me laughing at night -- one of the things that keep me laughing at night , and we &apos;ve never had to do that in fact , we never need .
And we also have never been able to do it reasonable , as we can now .
We &apos;re an amazing thing to astonishing events on many areas , and yet I really think that we have hundreds of , 300 years ago , 300 years ago , we have to go back to a time where we &apos;ve gone forward forward to find a time in which we &apos;ve been struggled with these things more fronts than the fronts are now .
People are hunting in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free .
Not even the truth will free .
And hear , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right on his mind .
But you know , what you don &apos;t have ?
They don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &quot; Don &apos;t have . &quot;
And I used a while to do that .
About a decade ago , I wrote a paper on vaccines for the New Yorker , a small article .
And I was amazed to be on an resistance to what &apos;s the most effective action is in human health in history .
I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do , so I just wrote a paper and I went on .
And pretty soon , I wrote a
The same thing , only bigger .
People were playing crazy .
So I also wrote a paper about it , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that that would be , &quot; Frankendom , &quot; why they thought that molecules were in a certain way that was in nature &apos;s area of nature .
But you know , I do what I do . I wrote the article , I keep writing the paper .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
We &apos;re going to reach out , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
But this article was worried , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally I found it .
And that &apos;s because these fan , that &apos;s one that I &apos;ve been crazy at all .
They were surrounded by people , educated people , including people .
They were just like the people in this room .
And that made me like this .
But then I thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
We &apos;ve been at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio that we don &apos;t have the same ratio
We &apos;re talking about wasteful of it .
We talk ironally about this , we &apos;re talking about , progress .
Okay , there &apos;s reasons , and I think we know what are reasons .
We have the trust in authority , and sometimes in authority , and sometimes in the science , and there &apos;s no reason why that should not be so .
You can just call a few names , and people will understand .
Tschernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , mass destruction , the U.S. presidential presidential cancer .
I mean , you know , you can choose their own list .
There are questions and problems with people that we thought they would have always be right , so you have skeptical .
Imagine asking questions , let &apos;s ask you to find evidence .
Take nothing .
But now , if you have to get the evidence , you have to take the evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
And I can tell the reason that we &apos;re living in an epidemic that we live in a epidemic of fish , as I &apos;ve never seen again and never again .
About 12 years ago , a story about 12 years ago , a horrible story that the autismushroom epidemic with the mies , and tube vaccine vaccine .
Very frightening .
Now , the studies have been done to see if this was the
Really studies have been done ; this is a serious issue .
The data came out .
The data came from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and they were all the same , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection .
It doesn &apos;t make a difference . It doesn &apos;t make a difference because we believe in Anekdotes , we believe what we see is that we &apos;re really feeling .
We don &apos;t believe in a curl documents of a government show that we have data , and I understand that I think we &apos;re all doing .
But you know what ?
The result of that was catastrophic .
Castrophal because of this fact , the United States is one of the only countries on the world where the implications for millers .
That &apos;s skandalous , and we should know .
It &apos;s awful .
What &apos;s happened is that we could do that .
Well , I understand that . That &apos;s what I do .
Because here &apos;s somebody mimers ?
Hat one single in the audience ever see someone who are dying ?
Not very often .
It doesn &apos;t even exist in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
These are many tode through millers , 20 per hour .
But because that &apos;s not happening here , we can push it , and people like Jenny McCarthy can walk around , and people like Jenny McCarthy and you can walk around and Larry King Live .
And they can do that because they &apos;re not connecting cause cause and correlation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the self are .
And this is something that we have to learn , very quickly .
This guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
He liberated us from one of the worst minds of humanity .
No fear , no quarters , child paralysis , diving , disappeared .
The guy in the middle is not so much .
He &apos;s called Paul Offit .
He just created a few other people with a Rotaya vaccine .
It can save the lives of 400,000 children per year in the developing world .
Pretty good , right ?
Well , that &apos;s good , except that Paul &apos;s walking around and says how valuable they are , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jamming .
And he actually says that .
So Paul is a terrorist .
When Paul talks about in a public owned , he can &apos;t tell you , he can &apos;t say
He gets at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
And why ? Because Paul has made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need that , but it &apos;s vaccinary .
If you go back to them , the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
We have now in this country today .
And this will get worse , and pretty soon , children die again , because this is just a question of the numbers .
And they &apos;re not just going to die .
What about child paralysis ? Take this . Why not ?
A couple of weeks ago , a commissioned me a couple of weeks ago , and she said , I &apos;m a little bit written .
Nobody said that before .
She wouldn &apos;t kill her child paralysis . On no case .
Fine .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have children . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have children in this country yesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe someone gets in Lagos in a plane , and it &apos;s just after Los Angeles , right now it &apos;s about Ohio .
And in a few hours , he ended up with a car , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go visit to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to go to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to come to go to Long Beach .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with the disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works now .
This is the planet that we live on . Don &apos;t do that .
We love that . We love that .
Have you taken this morning all of your vitamine ?
Egyptian , a little anti-oxium that helps you on the spring .
I know you &apos;ve done that , because half of the Americans are doing that every day .
They take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
The data is that all the time .
They make your judgment . It &apos;s almost never doing .
That &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark judgment .
I completely agree with you .
Dunkler urin dark .
Why do we do this ? Why do we do this ?
Well , I think I understand -- we hate the Pharma industry .
We hate a strong government . We have no trust in the system .
And that &apos;s what we should not . Our health care system is .
It &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely cold and sealongside itself that can afford it .
So we &apos;re going to move before , and where do we go ?
We run into the Arme of the placebo-industry .
That &apos;s great . I love the placebo-industry .
But you know , that &apos;s really a serious issue , because the stuff is mist , and we give billions of dollars to do it .
And I have all kinds of small regulations here .
None of them -- Gingko , bacea , bacea , concrete , Acai , because I don &apos;t even know what this is , but we give billions of dollars to do it .
And you know what ? If I say that , people are on me and say , &quot; What does it take care ? Have people do what they want .
That &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You have miserable .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter to me , whether it &apos;s the minister , who says , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of mammals , &quot; or any kind of cannaces who want to treat their patients with coffee .
If you give yourself to that path , where believes and magic broadcast and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
They go to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He brought 400,000 his people to take 400,000 of his people because he was that red beam , blowing and citronis much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can use the course of AIDS of AIDS .
In fact , hundreds of thousands of death in a country that &apos;s worse than each other of this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have a consequence .
They always have them . They always have .
Now , the great epidemic in which we &apos;re right epidemic in which we &apos;re right now is this absurd struggle between the funds and the bio elites .
This is a idiotic debate . It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate talking about words .
This is ideology , not science .
Everything we eat , every single rice , every single branch of peer , every branch changed by the people .
You know , there was no Mandarins in the paraise .
There was no cantales , there were no Christmas rooms . We didn &apos;t have Christmas trees . We did everything .
We did it in the last 11,000 years .
And some of this has not worked .
We &apos;ve gotten rid of what works .
Now we can do it in a way . And of course , there &apos;s risks , but we can do something like Vitamine , and the stuff can help millions of people to keep their lives longer .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say that I don &apos;t understand .
We reclubs changed food .
Why do we do that ?
Now , what I hear about the time is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormonoculture , we don &apos;t want a huge field with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t want companies to meet lives .
We don &apos;t want companies to own .
And you know what my answer to all of this ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s say that .
It &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
This has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s right , Moral , patent .
You know that the science is not a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do it , because we fear is a real cake , and it keeps millions of people from a
You know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to build 70 percent more food at the moment .
This investment in Africa in the last 30 years .
Except .
They need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
And why ? Genteve changed food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff like Maniok .
Maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s kind of like a potatoes .
It &apos;s just a round of calories . It &apos;s mies .
It doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any proteins , and scientists are doing all of this .
And then people could eat it and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
You wouldn &apos;t hungry , and you know what ?
That would be beautiful . It wouldn &apos;t be Panisse , but it would be nice .
And everything I can say about this is : Why are we fighting this ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight this ?
Because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
It &apos;s not about bringing genes around genes . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormone , our claims on greater food , unique food .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krispies , it &apos;s about getting people &apos;s life , and it will become highest time to understand what that means .
Because you know what ?
If we don &apos;t do that , if we go as far as we do so far as we &apos;re doing something that we want to , I don &apos;t want to be guilty to do that , I think we don &apos;t want to be
There &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
It &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not our worthy , and we have to really stop this .
So after this incredibly fun entertainment , you may say , &quot; Do you want to say , &quot; Do you want to go to the future ? &quot;
On the case , I want to be on every time .
At the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can do everything that we want to do .
We can move it where we want to move it , and we will move it where we want .
We need to perform these intersections , and we have to think , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be diverse .
I know that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
Thank you . Thank you .
When Steve Lopez , Columnist Los Angeles Times , one day through the streets of Los Angeles , he heard , he heard a wonderful music .
She came from a man , a African-American , sympathy , rau , homeless , gay , homeless , who had just two juified .
In fact , many of you know the story , because of Steves has been filmed with Robert Downey &apos;s been filmed with Robert Downey , as a Steve Lopez and Jamie Fox as a Nathanian , the Contrabassists who was on Juilliarrow , who was on Juilliarrow , who was approximity as well .
Nathaniel left Juilliard , had suffered a nearby , and 30 years later , he was living as homeless on the streets of SkRow in the center of Los Angeles .
I &apos;m missing all of you to read Steves book , or looking at the movie so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness , and how the music make this link between these two men , but also , as the music made this connection , and how eventually it was going to be able to get an instrument , when this word is to get out of the street .
I met Mr Ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in Walt Disney Conert Hall .
He had just heard a show of Beethovens and quarter of senses , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
He spoke in a very healing and social sound about Yo Ma and and Hillary Clinton Clinton and Hillary Clinton Clinton , and that would never do it in the baseball in World Series , and it &apos;s all because of the passengers in the first history of permeals .
We came to talk to music music . And a few days later , I got an email that was that Nathaniel was interested in their own education .
And I &apos;ve got to mention that Nathaniel had a medical treatment , because he was already an electroschocks and treated with Thorazin and trade , a trauma that has been following his whole life .
As a consequence of this , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic phanages , and the sometimes are so bad that they threatened it , and he slowed , in the streets of Skid Row , always this horror , always this horror and the tone of the horror of his mind .
And in the same same as a travel stage , Nathaniel , when we started with our first entertainment in the Walt Disney Concert Hall , and he had this irguns in his eyes and actually lost .
He spoke about invisible whe
I was scared , I didn &apos;t mean , but I was afraid that I could lose it in one of his conditions , and that I could get his relationship when I started , I was able to destroy his relationship when I started , I started to be able to talk about plans and other exciting shapes of the denoundacitide .
So I just started playing .
I was playing the first sentence of Beethovens Violinine .
And while I was playing , I noticed that in Nathangel &apos;s eyes a complete change .
It was , as if he stood under the influence of an invisible arznei , a chemical reaction , which was a chemical response that catalyst my game .
Nathanield manian Zorn related to understanding , in a ruhy New giver and mut .
And the way through a miracle , he took his violin and began to play a few clips of Violins , and then asked me to play it at the end : mendelsi , Tmalius .
We then started talking about music , from Bach on Beethoven , Brahms , Bruckner and all the other Bs , from Bartó&apos;s to Esa-Pecka .
And I realized that he was not just a enzyclopedic knowledge about music , but it with her also a very personal relationship .
He spoke to her with a passion , and one of the idea that I heard of my colleague in Los Angeles .
By the time he was talking about music and talked about music , from this paranoided guy who was dragged through the streets of Los Angeles , a lower-educated , in Juilliard musicians .
Music is medicine . music changes us .
For Nathaniel means music health .
Because the music allows him to be , his thoughts and elections with his imagination and creativity in something real .
And so he &apos;s going to figure out his case .
I understood that this is the nature of art .
And this is the reason why we make music : something that we do something that is in all of us , our feelings through our artistic lens through our artistic lens , through our creativity can form .
And the reality of that exhibition has achieved us all , and inspires us .
What Nathaniel went , so he took the music back into a community of friends .
The intriguing force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , his talent and he laughed .
And I &apos;m going to work with Nathaniel music , whether in the Walt Disney Concert Hall or Skid Row , because he reminds me of why I &apos;ve become musicians .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Thank you .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I want to play something that I had disabled the Cdignity .
I hope you &apos;ll leave you with me .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal .
I &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save save the world .
I have a plan for that . I want to persuade more people to spend all of your time playing a little bit more and great games .
We spend three hours a week , we spend three hours a week with online games .
Some of you might think , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
Maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have begun to solve in the real world .
But in fact , my research institution for the future , is exactly the opposite .
Three billion hours a week are not approximately enough to solve the most of the problems of the world .
In fact , I &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
I calculated that the time that the 21 billion hours of play per week .
That may seem to be a little bit , so I &apos;m going to make it happen : if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , I believe , we have to try games , I think we have to try to do games , at least 21 billion hours a week .
At the end of the next decade , no , I &apos;m really serious .
Why ?
Why I believe that games are so inhabitable for the survival of the human species in the future . It &apos;s severe .
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toledano .
He wanted to come up with the feelings of play . So he had built a camera in front of the players .
This is one of the classic piece of play .
If you &apos;re not a player , maybe you find some of the nuances in this picture .
And you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of dirty , something fear , but also by the first concentrations of a really difficult problem .
If you &apos;re also playing , you see a couple of nuances here , and the mouth are a sign of optimism , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
This is a player on the edge of a so-called epic victories .
Oh , you know that . OK .
So we have some players here .
A epic seg is a result , which is so positive that you didn &apos;t know before it was possible .
It was almost almost beyond the imagination . And if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re so capable . That &apos;s a epic seg .
This player is a minute before the epic seg .
And this is what we have to see on millions of factories around the world , if we take the hurdling of the next century , the face of the next century , and the face of the ones that are depending on the edge of the edge of a sea .
Well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we look hard problems .
I draw it as the &quot; In life , I &apos;m bad face . &quot;
And it &apos;s actually my face , do you see ? Yes ? OK .
That &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do in life , I &apos;m bad face .
This is a graffiti in my former home in Berkeley , California , where I studied in my Ph.D. in my Ph.D.
This is a problem that you have a lot of players .
We think that in reality , we &apos;re not as well as in play .
And I &apos;m not just less successful , even though that &apos;s about it .
We &apos;re getting more in play .
I &apos;m good in the context of motivation to do something significant , inspiring to collaborate with each other .
If we &apos;re in a game world , I think that many of us turn into our best version , we can turn into our best version , at the time , and we &apos;re going to try to solve as long as they need , as long as they need for the error .
And in reality , when we tell you , we often feel different .
We feel overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed , and we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrates , frustrated or
We never have these feelings if we play play games , we don &apos;t have it .
And that &apos;s what I wanted to see as a doctor
Why is it impossible to think of play , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
How can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
So I looked like the World of Warcraft that provides the ideal environment for a collaborative problem .
And I found some of the things that make the epic seals in online worlds .
So first , when you get into one of these online games , especially in the World of Warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to trust , and immediately .
But not just any mission , but a mission that adapt to the right right ?
So do that .
You never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
But always on the edge of your skills , so you have to come up .
But there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft , you don &apos;t sit around , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
And there &apos;s a lot of employees .
As you go , hundreds of thousands of people who are working with you to join your epic mission .
We don &apos;t have that simple in real life , this sense that at a fingertips are willing to stand up with staff .
And we also have this epic history , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do , and then we get this whole positive feedback .
You may have one of &quot; Level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 starch &quot; or &quot; + 1 power . &quot;
It &apos;s not a constant feedback in the real life .
If I leave this stage , I didn &apos;t , + 1 , and + 1 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get that feedback in the real life .
So the problem of cooperations online worlds like the World Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying where it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at a time at the edge of a stage .
They &apos;re just better than the reality .
Until today , all of the world , we have spent 5.93 million years trying to solve virtual problems of Azero-h .
That &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
It may sound sound .
But to see it in the context : 5.93 million years ago , our first primate primate primating .
So the first exciting primate .
OK , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play , it just makes sense , when you look at the time in terms of the size of human development , which is extraordinary .
But it turns out , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time on play , actually change that we &apos;re able to change as humans .
We &apos;re developing to collaborate , in collaborative creatures .
That &apos;s the truth . That &apos;s what I believe .
Let &apos;s look at this interesting statistics that recently , with a researcher of Carnegie Mellon , the average young man from today , the average young man from today in a country with powerful game culture today .
So , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
First of all , for kids in the United States , 10,080 hours , which they spend in school , from 5th grade to high school in five .
Parallelevevation , at the young people like what it means to be a good player , how everything they learn in school .
And maybe some of you have the new book from Malcolm Gladwell , survivors , so you know , you know , you know , the theory of success , the theory of success , the theory of success of the 10,000 hours .
It &apos;s based on the magnificent research , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the slow study of a particular particular particular particular character , until the 21st of life , we &apos;re going to be done in it .
We &apos;re going to be doing so well at what the most significant people in the world .
So , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-star .
So the big question is , &quot; What the
Because if we could figure this out , we never would have been there .
So many people , we have now in the world who spend at least one hour per day with online play .
These are our master players . These are 500 million people who are extraordinary .
And in the next decade , we have another billion player that &apos;s extraordinary , whatever they are .
If you haven &apos;t heard it .
The game industry is developing consoles that save energy and working on mobile devices , rather than the Breitband-Internet so player around the world , especially in India , China can play online .
You see an extra billion player in the next decade .
So we have 1.5 billion player .
So I started thinking about what it is to do in what it is to do in our games .
Here are the four things that I found . The first thing : Drighty optimism .
OK , imagine this as extreme self-motivation .
Drighty optimism is the desire to do something that we have an adolescents , together with the faith that we succeed on success .
Wars always believe that a epic seg is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and that &apos;s the same .
Don &apos;t sit around .
Player are most of the spiders of social nets .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show that we like people more , after we &apos;re playing with them , even if they &apos;ve seen us .
The reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
We trust that someone &apos;s time with us that the rules are held that we have the rules that we have the same goal and to stay with it .
So this allows you to play the collapses of connects , trust and with each other .
As a result , we build a stronger social relationships .
Luck-productivity . Fantastic !
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average Word of wait 22 hours a week is playing as a particle .
The reason is that , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , when we &apos;re relaxing or nothing .
We know that as human beings , as human beings , if we do hard , meaningful work .
And players are always ready to work , when they get the right job .
And finally , epic meaning .
Bad they love to become part of awe .
So here is a redefinition of the back to the right light , and you will know all of the Wikipedia , the greatest wizi of the world .
The second part of the world , with almost 80,000 people who is the World of Warcraft , is the World of Warcraft .
Five million people use it every month .
They have more information about the World of Warcraft in the Internet as any other topic in the world .
They create epic story .
They create epic source of knowledge about the World of Warcraft .
OK , so these are four superpower that will lead to a single result .
These are people who believe that they can change the world .
And the only problem is they believe , they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem I &apos;m trying to solve .
Edward Castroova is a conductor .
His work is brilliant . He looked .
People have so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re not going to witnessed by a mass emits in virtual worlds . &quot;
And this from an economist . So it &apos;s logical .
And he says -- not like me , I &apos;m developing games , I &apos;m a little more humble .
So he says that actually makes sense , because player can reach more than in the real life .
You can turn into play stronger social bonds than in the real life , and they get more backwards and rewards in play as the real life .
So he says it &apos;s absolutely logical at the moment that players spend more time in the virtual world than in the real .
I just agree that &apos;s logical . It &apos;s logical .
But it &apos;s definitely not an optimist .
We have to start changing the world into a game .
My inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years .
There are these ancient cube , from scales , you know ?
And this fantastic game trolls on this fantastic game trolls .
And these were sort of , like the first of people developed play , and if you &apos;re in the old Greek historics of the old Greek historic historians , you may know , this story about how and why games were invented .
Essentially , games have been invented games , at
There was such a great famine that the king of Lydien that king was decided to a crazy idea .
People did . People fought . People fought .
It was an extreme situation . You needed an extreme solution .
So they found out , loud
And they would be deep into dignity in dignity , because games are so fascinating and give us more satisfying , happy productivity , they would forget productivity so they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
And then the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
And loud Herodotus survived for 18 years , they lived this dog for a day and on a day .
In the same way , I think , let &apos;s put games today .
We &apos;re putting games to get the suffering of the real world , and we &apos;re putting games , and we &apos;re going to make a lot of stuff that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and we &apos;re going to get out what we need from playing .
But that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
This is the Spanish .
After 18 years , it didn &apos;t go after 18 years , which was not better , so the qug , and so the king was going to be a last dignity .
They divided the Kingdom in two .
They were playing a dignity , and the victories of an adventure .
They let poetry poetry and made a new home search for a new home home , and they were just so many people , like the food to survive , and they were looking for the rest in which they were able to survive .
That sounds crazy , right ?
But the recent DNA evidence show that
And so recently , scientists came to see that Herodotus is actually true crazy story .
And geologists found evidence of a Global ab
So this crazy story could be true .
Maybe they actually saved their people through play by games by having swallowed for 18 years in games , and then they &apos;ve been able to play so much about the one another that has saved saved saved by the whole civilization .
So , we can .
We &apos;ve been playing in 1994 Warcraft .
That was the first strategies for real time .
The World of Warcram . That was 16 years ago .
They were playing dignity for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing waiting for 16 years .
I say we &apos;re willing to our own epic game .
So , they sent to half their civilization on the search for a new world , and so I &apos;m going to take my 21 billion game per week .
We should transmit in it that half of us an hour to play every day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the world .
I know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; How do we solve problems in the world .
In play ? &quot; And that question , I &apos;ve dedicated my work in the last years , I &apos;ve dedicated my work
We have this banner in our office in Palo Alto , the way we should understand the future .
We don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
What we want to do is to create the future .
We want to have the best result , and then people are empowering this idea into reality .
We imagine epic victories and give people the opportunities to reach them .
I &apos;m going to show you three games that I designed to try to make people epic seals in their own future .
This is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
The game is from 2007 .
It &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil scarcity .
The oil blown is invented , but we have an online content , so it &apos;s going to be realistic and you actually live on your life without oil , so if you &apos;re going to play , tell us where you &apos;re running . And then you get the news movies in real time that you can get , and then you get news news news films in real time that give you a lot of oil , which is not how much food supply .
And you have to figure out how to make schools are , whether it &apos;s been true , and you have to figure out how you create your real life , if it &apos;s true . And we ask you to blogging out , video or Photos .
We &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tested it over the last three years since .
And I can tell you , it was a changing experience .
Nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
But if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and said , &quot; We &apos;re the oil goes from . &quot;
This is a fascinating adventure where you go .
Five out how you were going to survive , most of our players who have forgotten their lives in the game .
So we have a little bit more than the next game , we have a bigger goal , we have a bigger target , and there &apos;s oil scarcity .
We &apos;ve developed the game supermarkets for the future .
So this point is the computation of a supercomputer , that people only have 23 years in the rest of the planet .
This supercomputer is called &quot; global extinction system , of course . &quot;
The phone phone call to players , dancing , we &apos;ve made almost like a Jerry-Bruckheimer .
You know , Jerry movies where there is the script team , where there is the script team , and they have the astronomer , the scientists , the ex-strators and only can save them .
But in our game , instead of just five people , everybody in the turn is a team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , health , security and the future of the social justice .
8,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
They found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read if you &quot; supermarkets . &quot;
And the last game we put on three . It &apos;s a game in collaboration with the World Bank .
If you close the game , you get from the World Bank , &quot; Social reactor , &quot; degrees of 2010 .
We &apos;re working in a very sub-Saharan Africa , and download it a social redesign .
We have a comic to that . We have &quot; Level up up &quot; for local entertainment , knowledge , vision and unemployment .
I want to upload all of this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , especially in the developing countries that are benefits together to save their own social entrepreneurs to save the world .
I &apos;m going to come to the end .
I want to ask you something .
What happens next ?
We have all these fantastic players that we show , what we can do , but we don &apos;t have saved the real world yet .
Well , I hope that you will agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a huge change for change .
We have these entire superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to crack social nets , the ability to handle social networking , we make sense of epic meaning .
I really hope that we &apos;re going to play meaningful games to survive on this planet another century .
And I hope you &apos;ll design with me like that .
When I &apos;m predicted to the next decade , I &apos;m sure that we can create every single future , and that we can play every single future , and that we can play all sorts of games . So I say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to say ,
Thank you .
For some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the placebo-effect , and it may seem odd that a magician interested in this , it &apos;s because you look like me , &quot; a deception that will be a magnitude that &apos;s going to be a little bit of it . &quot;
In other words , sugar piles have shown in some studies have a measurable effect , the placebo-effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s going on is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , there &apos;s because the patient beliefs , a measurements that you &apos;re called the plenty of effects .
It &apos;s a deception to a little bit more awesome , because someone does it .
So we can also understand each other , I want to show you a very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . That &apos;s a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s .
I met him from the Cub Scout Magic Badfinder in the 1970s .
I &apos;m going to take it for you and then explain it .
And then I &apos;m going to explain why .
So you see what happens .
The knife that you can study , my hand you can study .
I &apos;m just going to keep the knife .
I &apos;m going to go back to my sleeping .
And to make sure that nothing goes away in my era , or it turns out , I &apos;m just going to express my wrist right here .
In this way , you can see that nobody is going to move anything , and as long as I get here , nothing in my sleeping or out .
And the goal of this is very simple .
I &apos;m going to open up , and hopefully , I &apos;m going to open the knife by my hand , your knies will be fixed by my hand , physically .
It &apos;s actually stuck with his place that I can shake it , without the knife goes down .
Nothing goes into my era or comes out , no trickle . And you can study everything .
Ta-da !
Now , this is a trick that I often bring little little children who care about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you can see a lot about deception , although it &apos;s a very simple leading trick .
Now , many of you are familiar with this trick .
It works .
I think the knife in my hand .
I say that I &apos;m close to my wrist , to make sure that nothing &apos;s disappearing in my era , and this is a lie .
The reason why I encountered my wrist is old , that &apos;s where the actual secret of illusion is the illusion .
In the moment , where I mean my hand out of you , so you can see them from , that finger here , my drawing , just from there where he was , in a position that he was so frightened in a position where he was so frightened .
Toller Trick ?
There &apos;s somebody sitting there who had no childhood no childhood .
So , he is here . Exactly .
And when I turn out , the finger changes its position .
And now you could talk about why this is a deception is , why you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s just three fingers : because the mind and the way it works information is not about one , two , three , but she looks as a group .
But this is not about now . And then I open up here , and then I open my hand
Of course , it &apos;s going to be there , but not through the magnetism of my body , but it &apos;s through a trick that &apos;s now .
And when I was close to my hand , it happens by walking back , through this movement becomes boring , that the finger is moving back .
I &apos;ll take that hand . And here &apos;s the knife .
This is the trick you can do your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now , what does that have to do with the placebo-effect ?
A year ago or something like this , I read a study that I really did .
I &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and that was an amazing thing .
And it turns out that if you have a placebo in the form of a white mushroom , in the form of an aspirle , and it &apos;s just a little bit , white mushroom that has a certain measure of effect .
But if you look at the shape that you will change the placebo , for example , in a smaller mushroom , and that is a little bit of a little bit of it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
And that , although no one of these pharmaceutical apps .
But a white pille is not as good as a blue mushroom .
What ? That made me really drilled me .
But it turned out that &apos;s not all this .
If you take the capsules , it &apos;s even more effective than the tablets of each form .
There is a farming capsule in the end , and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
It &apos;s also a role to play .
A mushroom is not as good as three piles -- I can &apos;t remind myself of the precise statistics . I &apos;m sorry .
The decisive thing is .
And that &apos;s also a role to play .
And the shape is a role plays .
And if you want to have the ultimate placebo-effect , you have to access to the needle .
Right ? A spinning
It creates a very strong image in the head . It &apos;s a very much stronger than a white mushroom .
This graph is really -- I &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a project .
So the fact is that the white pilot doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue piles that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
And nothing of this has a really pharmaceutical vehicle , and it &apos;s just our faith that &apos;s getting a stronger impact .
I wanted to know if I could use this idea for a magic trick .
I guess something that obviously is a deception , and let it look really .
We know from this study that we have to access to the needle , if you want to go to this thing .
This is an inch long hutnaull . It &apos;s very , very , very short , and I &apos;m going to get them a little bit of sterile .
This is really my meat . It &apos;s not Damians in the field of meat .
This is my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood .
So I &apos;m going to run this needle in my skin , and I will drive them through the other side .
If you &apos;re lowered -- if you &apos;re easy in nososes -- I &apos;ve led a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people I didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s almost habitable .
So I &apos;m kidding if you &apos;re very quick , you &apos;re going to look for the next 30 seconds , you know what , I &apos;m going to do the first dark part here .
You can see it in the same way , but you can see away when you want .
So , this is , right here , where my meat starts , on the bottom of my arms , I &apos;m just going to make a little bit of
I &apos;m really sorry . Are you crazy ?
And now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of this , again , again ,
Now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation that we had in the measurements .
About .
But now you can &apos;t count my finger , right ?
So I &apos;m going to show you . That &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
Well , yeah .
I know what people think when they see .
They say , &quot; Okay , that &apos;s certainly not so badly and the skin itself itself , the skin itself , just to undercover us for a few minutes . &quot;
Well , then I &apos;m going to show you .
So what this looks like ? Pretty good .
Yeah , I know . And people say , &quot; Okay . I don &apos;t have seen this right . &quot;
People are now in the side parts are now .
So let me show you a little bit close .
That &apos;s really my skin . This is not a special effect from Hollywood .
That &apos;s my meat , and I can turn it around .
I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re wrong , look , don &apos;t look .
So the people , or the people who would see that later at the video , you know , &quot; Well , it &apos;s quite an impressful , but if it was real , he would -- you see , there &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really , it would be really , it would be kind of blooded . &quot;
Okay , let me take a little bit of blood for you .
Yes , here it is .
Now , I would take the needle out now .
I would love my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
But I think , in this frame , and with the intention of making something real , I &apos;m going to leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
We &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next days .
I hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . Thank you very much .
So I took a lot of fish in my life .
I just loved two .
That first , that was more like a lightweight .
It was a beautiful fish , weduty , good consistent , a brittle on the memory card .
What a fish for a fish .
Even better , he became an aquaculture after the most part of the sustainability of sustainability .
So you could feel like to sell it .
I had this beauty a relationship about several months .
One day called the Chef of the company , and he asked if I could carry on the sustainability of color .
&quot; Of course , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to solve what this unthinkable problem has become this unbelievable problem for our minds , and how do we keep fish on the
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been beaten the ocean as we did .
It &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
90 percent of the fish that we love , the Thunfish , the sake , the sake , the Lachse , and they have collapsed .
It &apos;s almost nothing else .
So it &apos;s probably going to be an elsesewhere , will be part of our future .
A lot of the arguments . We use the environment that most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna .
He has 15 to come up with a 15 to one .
That means 15 pounds of wildlife is necessary so that you get a path to get a path and get tuna .
Not very sustainable .
Not very well .
So here was finally a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
At the day , I called the Chef of the publishation for the company .
Let &apos;s call it Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for doing so far outside in the sea , that you &apos;re not polluting the environment . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out that the crash will be distributed by our fish . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; We are basically its own world .
This case by 2,5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; The best in the industry . &quot;
2,5 to one , great .
&quot; 2,5 to one thing ? What do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; I said .
And that night , I was in bed , and I thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So I called the next day , just before the design , Don .
I said , &quot; Don , &quot; What is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
He said , he didn &apos;t know . He &apos;s going to
Now , I went on the phone with a couple of people in the company . No one could give me an esthetic answer , and I was going to end with the elevated biologists .
We also call it Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; What are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned a couple of algae , and then he said , chicken pelevators , and then he said ,
I said , &quot; Child Pellets ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yes , feeds , skin , steady , rested , rested , burned , rested , and he said , &quot; Yes ,
I said , &quot; How much percent Futters is chicken ? &quot;
maybe two percent .
&quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what is sustainable going to have chicken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long pause in the suffering , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
I fell in love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m a self-urgent genesis .
That &apos;s actually me .
No , I was in love of this fish , because , I weak up with God , the fish after this entertainment , after this entertainment
That second fish , this is a different kind of love history .
It &apos;s the romantic kind of , the kind of , the way that you learn your fish you &apos;re in love with more .
I used to eat him in a restaurant in the South Africa .
There was a well-known journalist for a long time in this fish .
It &apos;s kind of embedded us .
He came to the table with a light , almost weak color .
The cooked him .
Hold second .
Obviously , he was still a conventional .
Who can leave a fish so tastes as well after he got cook ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him miguels . In fact , he &apos;s called Miguel .
And no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a cook , but at least the way that you and I understand underneath .
He &apos;s a biologist in Veta La Palma .
This is a fish to be up in the southern corner of Spain .
It &apos;s close to the mouths of gualway .
Until the &apos; 80s , the color in the hands of Argentina .
They were sketches on what they were basically wetlands .
They did that by changing the country .
They built this complicated impacts of channels , and they put it out of the country and out in the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make sure that the same thing , not economically .
And ecologically it was a disaster .
It took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds in the place .
And so 1982 is an exciting company with environmentmentally conscious country .
What did they do ?
They removed the river of the water .
They literally put the levers .
Instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to pull the water again .
They started the channels .
They created a 150,000 hectares -- Barsch , seas , seas , garnels , Aal -- and there are miguel , and his company , the ecological destruction .
The color is incredibly .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
They &apos;re staring at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything they can see filed channels and this dense , whistling March .
I didn &apos;t have a long time in front of Miguel .
It &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts Charles Darwin and a part of &quot; A codic . &quot;
Okay ? So because we were and fought us through the woods , and I &apos;m blank and sweating , I have Matsch up to my knees , and miguel is holding into a bic lecture .
Here he picks up a rare equar .
Now , he mentioned the mineral clusters of phytoplankton .
And here , this is the
It turns out that migration has spent the biggest part of his career in the Pacific .
I asked him how he has become such a fish experts .
He said , &quot; Fish ? I know nothing about fish .
I &apos;m a couple of relationships . &quot;
And then he goes down , and it goes down into more smoke of birds and algae and weird water .
And don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unpled , like this .
It &apos;s great , but I was love .
And my head was going to get a little bit of a delightforward .
So I went down . I said , &quot; Wheel , how does it take a fish so tastes like this ? &quot;
He showed the algae .
&quot; I know , boy , the ytoplankton , the relationships , which is incredibly .
But what does the fish ?
How is the fingertips ? &quot;
Well , he continued to tell me that it &apos;s such a powerful system is that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
The plant plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the Zooplankton , which is what the fish feed .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely autonomous .
There &apos;s no food .
What about a farm is the animal that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
Later the day , I went around this piece of paper , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems to be so obviously , &quot; For a place that I &apos;ve ever been like , &quot; How do you success ? &quot;
In the moment , it was , as if a film was a refrigerator .
And we bow around the corner , and we offered an incredible view , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pingo , a literally pinker carpet .
&quot; That &apos;s success , he said .
&quot; Look at the pink of their legs , pink .
They &apos;re bad . &quot;
Back ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , don &apos;t wait a fish fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fisheries in the birds .
Now last year , last year , 600,000 birds , more than 250 different ways .
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private Vogelreservations in this Europe .
I said , &quot; Miguel , is a good gear that you want to have up on a fish ? &quot;
He shake his head , no .
He said , &quot; We &apos;re building exclusive , not intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The Flamingos eat the garden .
The garden eat eat the phytoplankton .
So the pinker the system better . &quot;
Okay , let &apos;s think that . A color that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a color that doesn &apos;t feed their lives .
A fish up , but also a bird reservation .
Oh , by the way , and by the way , they shouldn &apos;t even be there .
They were breed in a city 240 miles away , where the boxes is better for the nest construction .
Every morning , they fly 240 miles to paint .
And every night , they fly 240 miles back .
They &apos;re doing this because they were running the white line of A92 .
Seriously .
I proposed a kind of journey of penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , they fly 240 miles back to the farm , and then they fly 240 miles back the night ?
Do they do that for kids ? &quot;
He looked at me when I was just a song of Whitney .
He said , &quot; No . You do that because the food is better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t just like the skin of my favorite fish that was delicious , and I don &apos;t like a fisherman , and I don &apos;t like mad . I don &apos;t like
It &apos;s this both , you know .
I almost never do that .
And yet , when I tried it in this restaurant in the South Africa , she didn &apos;t sneak them at all .
It tastes sweet and it , as if you would take a blow away from the ocean .
I mentioned the migrants and it .
He said , &quot; The skin works like a pig .
It &apos;s the last downstream before something comes into the body .
It &apos;s developed over the course course of evolution . &quot;
And then he added , &quot; But our water has no units . &quot;
OK . A color
And then I realized , when he says a color that doesn &apos;t have inhabit in , it &apos;s a lot , you know , the water that &apos;s flying through this farmer &apos;s flowing from the river gualway .
It &apos;s a river that &apos;s all the things with itself , from the rivers tend to lead them , chemical pollutants , they have chemical pollutants , abundance of damage .
And when it comes through the system , and this lost is the water , the water as it was coming .
The system is so healthy , it turns out the water .
So not just a color that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farms that their success on the health of their mature health , but a color that literally is a color that literally is a farm , and not only for these fish , but also for this fish , but also for this fish , but also for this fish I and me .
Because when the water flows out , it turns out in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;m going to take it , and that you should do , because this love history as a romantic story as a romance .
You could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future food , whether we &apos;re talking about bars or coaches .
What we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where the food actually is good .
But for many people , this is a little too radical .
We &apos;re not a regulators , we are lovers . We are lover .
We love the weekeepers . We love small family paths , and we &apos;re talking about regional food . We &apos;re eating bio .
And if you say that these things are the things that are the future of food is somebody somewhere and says , &quot; Hey , people , I love pingos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How will you feed the world ? &quot;
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like this question .
No , not because we already have enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed the world .
A billion people are hungry today .
A billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because it &apos;s racing inequality in the distribution , not the total production .
Now , I don &apos;t like this question , because it has the logic of our last 50 years .
Give grain plant eat grain of plant , foundations of monocultures , chemicals on Earth , the Earth , chicken has fish , and the whole time has the agricultural industry just said , &quot; If we feed more people cheaper , like , &quot; If we feed more people cheaper , like that can be ? &quot;
That was the left , and it was the reproduction . It was the retail . It was the business splan American agriculture .
We should call them what it is , an advance , a decrease , which rapidly enables .
This is not agriculture . It &apos;s not agriculture .
Our coral chamber is threthreatened , not because abandoned train resources .
It &apos;s not through the latest munning and trajectory inventions , but by lightweight land , not through pump , but through fresh water , not by pipes , but by fresh water , and not through fisheries , and not through fish , but by fish in the ocean .
You want to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How will we feed ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create conditions that feed every community , to feed themselves ?
In order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and chemistry and machines are in it , and it has never produced something really good for food .
Let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
That &apos;s the thing that goes back in two billion years .
Look , Miguel , farmers like , farmers like , farmers like , Miguel .
Between them who are not the worlds for themselves , they &apos;re using them , instead of using only intensive , concrete letters that are exclusive instead of just intensive , farmers who are not only , they &apos;re experts , but experts for relationships .
Because they are the people who are also experts .
And when I &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better cook than I will ever be .
You know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s going to be delightforward .
Thank you .
I grew up with a gear portrait of Science fiction .
And in my school time , I went to school with the Bus school , every day .
And my nose used to a book , a science fiction book , a science fiction book , which is my thoughts in other worlds that led my thoughts into other worlds in me , inququiry resatisfaction .
This is the new giver showed that I was always , when I wasn &apos;t in the school , I went through the forests , go and &quot; samples , and &quot; Profffans and sheets and beetetle and beetles and sweet and beetetles and a little bit of the microscope .
I was so excited , you know .
It was always about the attempt to understand the world , and the boundaries of the potential .
And my love to Science fiction seemed in my surroundings , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and explored the deep sea .
Jacques Cousteau came into our living room with his infants that we have never imagined .
So this has been very good at the point of science fiction .
And I was an artist .
I could call it . I was able to draw .
And there &apos;s no video games still this overall imaging with computer-generated films yet the whole language in the media landscape , I had to create the images in my head .
We had to all that . If we had to get a book , we took the description of the car , we took the description of the car and pro
And my response to this was the line and mals of alien worlds , robotic , spacecraft , robotic , spacecraft , and all
In the math class , I was rejected by teachers , as I was hidden in the back textbook .
The creativity had to be kind of out .
And this is something interesting happened to me at Jacques Cousteer from Sendings , it was a completely unknown world to us here on Earth .
I would never be able to achieve an extraordinary world with a spaceship , and this seemed pretty unlikely .
But here was a world that I could actually affect , here on Earth , and it was just kind of fascinating and exotic like all of what I had been given when I read that books .
So I decided when I was 15 , I decided when I was 15 ,
The only problem was that I lived in a small village in Canada , 1,000 kilometers away from the next ocean .
But I didn &apos;t leave that .
I nerved my father , until he finally made a dive school in Buffalo , New York , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
I made my dive into a pool of YCA in the middle of the Winter in Buffalo , New York .
The ocean , but a real ocean , I had just two years later , when we went to California .
Since then , in the 40 years that &apos;s inbetween the 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours under the water , and a 500 hours of diving .
And I learned that the world of deep sea , even in the oceans , even in the oceans , so rich with life is how we can really hardly think of it .
The fantasy of nature doesn &apos;t have borders , in contrast to our own , noisy human imagination .
By the time , I find the deepest honored honestly for what I see in my dive .
And my love to the ocean with the same intensity of intensity ,
And when I was searching for an adult , it was the filmies .
That seemed to be the best way to tell me to create stories with my need to create images with my need to create images .
When I was a kid , I just drew comics and so .
And so films
Of course , the stories that I looked at , from the science fiction room : &quot; Terminator , &quot; Terminator , &quot; and &quot; Abyss . &quot;
In Abyss , I could put my preference for the underwater world and the dives with the film .
So my two passions were kind of passions .
Something interesting happened in the abyss of &quot; Abyss &quot; to solve a narrative problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water -- and we had to create a computer-generated animation , CG , back .
And what came out was the first computer-generated software shows that was ever able to see in a movie .
The film was not a money , just said that he was just playing his productivity , but I noticed something fired : the audience around the world was like hypnotized , the audience all over the world was like hypnotized
In fact , Arthur Clarke &apos;s Law Clarke &apos;s Law Clarke .
So you saw something magical .
And that &apos;s what I found was more exciting .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , that needs to be engaged in the film . &quot;
So we went to Terminator 2 , my next film , even further .
Together with ILM , we made the guy out of liquid metall metal , and the success was just the way that effect would come up with how this effect .
And it worked .
From these two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity
So I started a company where I
The grass of this company was , the phase analog processes with optical printing with optical printing with the optical printing .
We also did this , and we managed to create a competition for a long time .
But in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in creature-- and Character design -- which we had started to slow forward forward .
I had written this piece of avatar , which would have been the knife in things of visual effects and computer-generated effects in a very new height , with stable human , impressive charts that were made by the CG . And the world should be CG . And the world should be CG . And the world
But the knife back , and the people in my company told me that we wouldn &apos;t still be able to do that .
So if I did this , and made this other film about the big ship , which is the bottom .
And as a movie study study , I sold this as &quot; Romeo and Julia on a ship . It &apos;s a love film epic extent , a
But in fact , I wanted to go to the real wrack of Titanic .
So I made the film .
That &apos;s the truth . The studio didn &apos;t know .
But I convinced them by saying , &quot; We &apos;re going to go to the wrack , and we film the real thing .
We &apos;re going to show it in the back of the film .
That &apos;s really important . It &apos;s a good hanger for marketing . &quot;
And I returned it to an expedition .
Sounds crazy . But that goes back to the idea that your imagination can create a reality .
In fact , we created a reality , six months later , where I found myself in a Russian dive boat , four kilometers under the surface of the North Atlantic , and I looked at the real Titanic through a flower .
This was not a movie , not HD , that was really .
So , it really drives me .
And the preparations were enormously . We had to build cameras and make it all sorts of things .
And I noticed how much these deep-sea seed , a space looked like this .
Well , they were also high-tech and burned plantation .
You go up into that capsule , you &apos;re going to be in this dark , holic environment , where you don &apos;t get on saving , if you don &apos;t
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is the same as I would be in a science fiction movie .
That &apos;s really cool . &quot;
I was quite obsessed with the ancient ocean .
Anyway , from the part that has done with curiosity and science . It was all the time , it was a new imagination . It was a imagination .
And it was an experience that couldn &apos;t give me Hollywood .
Because , you know , I could think of a creature that we could make a visual effect , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I would see outside the window .
I &apos;ve seen some of the following expeditions , I &apos;ve seen creatures , and sometimes things that I had never seen before , and sometimes things that I &apos;ve never seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw it , there was no words at all .
So that took me right , and I wanted more .
And then I met a little bit unusual decision .
After the success of Titanic &quot; I said , &quot; Okay , I want to put my primary professional as a filmmaker in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to go for a while researchers . &quot;
And then we started to plant these expeditions .
We went to &quot; Bismaris , &quot; and we explored them with robotic tools .
We went back to Wrack the Titanic .
We took a little robot that we built a fibergled fabulous .
Our intent was , in fact , looking at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
No one had ever been the inside of the wracks , you had no means for that , so we developed the technology .
Now , I &apos;m sitting on the deck of the cover of the Titanic , in a dive , and I see planks that these beats are pretty similar , and I know that was playing the band there .
And I fly with a little robotic vehicle through the glasses of the ship .
I &apos;m just denying it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
It felt , as I would be physical within the ship to the cover of the Titanic .
That was the most surreal shape of a Dée , which I &apos;ve ever seen , because before I bog around a corner , I knew what was the same in the light , I knew what was the same in the light , because I was going to run the movie .
In fact , the Set was a copy of the construction plans of the ship .
So this was an extremely odd experience .
She made this tendency experience that you can use such a robotic experience that you can use such a robotic kind of irreference , and so your own awareness in the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
It was really a profound profound thing .
And maybe also a little look at what might happen in a few decades , if you have cyborg body to do something or do things , in all sorts of post-human-officers .
After these expeditions , we started to know what we had seen at the bottom , for example , these deep-sea equals where we saw these incredibly amazingly amazing animals , and these are sort of alizingly amazing animals , but here on Earth .
They live with chemistry .
They don &apos;t exist in a sun-based system , how we do that .
And this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees Celsius .
We can &apos;t imagine that they can survive there . And you can &apos;t imagine that they can survive there .
At the same time , I was very interested in space science , and that was the science fiction of my childhood .
And so I ended up with the people who have been interested in doing the space and who have to do with NASA and sitting in NASAach-sharing , and they &apos;re going to Russia , and they &apos;re going to Russia , and they &apos;re going to be able to Russia , they go through the mission of all the Dran and the Dran , and then fly to international
That was fascinating .
But at the end , it went out to the end that I took space with us in the deep sea .
I took them with , and I promised them access to the world , Arobiologists , planetary scientific , people who have been interested in these extreme situations like this , and I took them to see how they were able to look around and try and find instruments and so on .
We went to a documentary films , but we actually actually do science , we know , space science .
So this is how the circle between my existence as the science fiction of my existence as a child and the reality in the reality .
I &apos;ve learned a lot of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science , but I &apos;ve learned a lot about leaders .
Now , you know , a director needs to be able to lead , a leader like a shipping thing , or something like a shipping
I didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before I spin these expeditions .
Because at a certain point , I had to say , &quot; What am I doing here ?
Why do I do that ? What &apos;s this ? &quot;
They don &apos;t bring us any money .
We &apos;re going to play on the production production , not a trace .
All think I was between Titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar . &quot;
I have all these films , this documentary film , for a very small audience .
No ruhm , no money . What do you do ?
You &apos;re doing it for the task , and the ocean is the challenge -- and the ocean is the challenging environment , which is challenging the most challenging environment , and you &apos;re doing it , and because of the strange connection that comes , when a small group of people a team .
Because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working together with only 10 to three months .
And in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that you have to have a job that you have , because you have a job that you can explain .
If you go back to land and say , &quot; We had to do it , the fiberglas , the fabulous , and the whole thing that the technology , and the difficulty , human achievements , if you work on the lake , &quot; then you just can &apos;t explain the other . It &apos;s like police or with soldiers who have something together , and you can &apos;t explain it .
There &apos;s a link , and there &apos;s a connection .
So when I came back to turn my next movie &quot; avatar , &quot; I was trying to use the same leadership leadership , which is that you rescted , and they deserve in the opposite direction .
That was really changed the dynamics .
So I stood again with a little team on ununknown terrain , and we turned out &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that had not yet .
The exciting thing .
A huge challenge .
And we became a period of four and a half years of a right family .
That changed my way to make movies , completely completely .
There were people who said , we would have been really good at night and on the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more a basic way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in .
So what can we close from all this ?
What are we learned ?
I think the first place is the curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful human property .
Our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
And the athroom is more important than all the lorbeer of this world .
To me , young filmmaker who say , &quot; Get me a advice , how I can do something like this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t give you yourself .
That &apos;s a little bit more worried for you . Don &apos;t get your own , don &apos;t wake up against themselves . &quot; Right ? &quot;
NASA has such a favorites : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
But in the art and the research has to be a sense of failure , because there &apos;s a trusty store .
Not a very important conclude , the innovation was ever done without risk .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
This is the thought that I &apos;d like to give you a way to give you a little bit , but it &apos;s not . Thank you .
If I want to get close to you today is that the overall of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking about information that I want you to think about how we can use information so that we can use information as we can use that patterns , and we recognize that are not seen .
So what we see here is a typical star diagram on the age of age .
The program I use here is a little experiment .
It means that I can do with pivot , is that I can filtering for a certain death cause , let &apos;s say accidents .
And immediately , I see another pattern that makes it .
And that &apos;s because in the middle range here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re most excited about here .
We can take a step further out , and then start to see the data , and see that circulating disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
Now , if we go forward and after age , let &apos;s look at 40 years or recent , we see that accidents are even the main cause of the people should be worried .
And who continues to see this is actually true in men .
So you can see that there &apos;s information and data in this way that is really remembering a swim in a living information image .
And if we can do this information for raw ourselves ?
So what we have here is the cover of every single &quot; Sports Illustrata that was ever printed .
It &apos;s all here . It &apos;s all online .
You can test it for my talk to you in your stomach .
With pivot , they can swap into a decade .
You can swap into a particular year .
You can directly to a certain copy .
Now , if I look at the point , I see the athletes that are in this copy and the athletes .
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong Fan , so I &apos;m looking at what I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m just going to show you the Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I just want to get a magnificent overhead , I could think , &quot; OK , what if I &apos;m looking at all with the topic drive ? &quot;
So I go a step back and get the perspective .
Now I see Greg Lemond .
And so you get an idea of that if you &apos;re looking through this kind of information , geek , broader , broader , broader , you don &apos;t just go .
You do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way that information can be used .
I want this idea now a little bit further with what &apos;s a little bit crazy .
What we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single single Wikipedia , and reduced it to a little strescue .
The summary contains a short oversight and a symbol of where it comes from .
I just want to show the top 500 of the most popular Wikipedia .
But even in this case , we can do a lot of things .
As soon as we get an impression about the topics that are the most popular .
I &apos;m going to choose the topic of the government .
Now , after I &apos;ve been looking at the government , I know that the Wikipediatories that most of the time , Time magazines are &quot; people of the year . &quot;
This is really important , because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t get into a single Wikiseat .
That &apos;s just to see a step back and look at this whole .
So in a certain sense , I can go into the topic of Time magazine , I can go into the subject of Time magazine , and we all see together .
Now , if I look at all these people , I know that the majority of the government officials are from science .
And interestingly , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
So we can now go and take a look at all TED Prize winner .
You see , we surfing in the net the first time that it &apos;s really a net , not just from page , but a lot of abstract .
And so I want to show you what else is a little surprise .
Let me just show you the New York Times website .
Pirap , this app -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at the websites like this .
So I can go back to a step back , just to a specific sector sector .
And that &apos;s so important because you can just look at the moment of websites in this way , the whole Internet can look at the same way .
So , I can go to a single person in a particular time .
Here &apos;s the stand the entire demonstration that I &apos;ve given to this .
And I can sort of what I &apos;ve seen today before , get back .
And when I remove a step back and look at everything , I &apos;m going to be able to reinvent my past . Here , I &apos;ve been looking for a super-past . Here , I looked at nearby , or here after LiLabs Pivot .
And from here , I can go into the page and make it again .
It &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s over again , and every time it makes the total picture greater than the sum picture of data .
At the moment , in the world , we think that data is a flight .
We &apos;re talking about the aircraft of information .
We talk from drowin information .
What if we could turn this situation , and put the Internet on your head , so that we &apos;re always going to go from one another , begin to go from one of many things , and to make patterns that would be more bored ?
If we can do this , it &apos;s going to be able to do this , maybe a new source of
And , rather than just move into information , we can get knowledge of it .
And if we know , then maybe we can actually pull out out out of it .
So I hear a lot , thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness .
I have some people on the number of books that have been published with &quot; Happiness &quot; in the last five years , and there was a lot more .
There &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness under researchers .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
Everyone would like to make people happier .
But despite all that grains of work , there &apos;s several cognitive findings , there &apos;s several cognitive tracks that would make it quite impossible to think about happiness .
And my talk today is mostly
That &apos;s true for Laia , who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so through each other .
The first of all of this is a resistant complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is just not just a local word , because we apply it to many different things .
I think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we might have a certain point of it , but in the Great , and there is something that we have to give up , and we &apos;re going to get the complicated perspective on what well-being .
The second fees is a change of life and memory : basically it &apos;s being happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life or happy with his life .
And these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both thrown into the notion of happiness .
And the third one is the concentration of illusion , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a state that we can &apos;t think about a state of well-being .
I mean , this is a real cognitive fees .
There &apos;s just no way to get it right .
Now , I would like to start with an example of somebody who had a question of a lectures that had a story , who was a story , who was a story of a story . &#91; unclear &#93; He said , he said , he would have a neutral music , and at the end of the recording there was a gorgeous music .
And then he faded , really emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
But it didn &apos;t .
What it was ruined the memories of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had had been hitting music for 20 minutes .
They didn &apos;t want to be because he was talking to memory , and the memory was remembered , and the memory was everything that he had gotten to the claim .
What that really tells us is that we could think about us and more people in the sense of two species of self .
There &apos;s a living self in the present and the present in the present , and the present present , is also the present to the past , but
It &apos;s the self that the doctor of the doctor -- you know , if I ask you , &quot; You know , you know , if I give you a fiber ? &quot;
And then there &apos;s a remembering self , and that reminded the self that matters and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the physician talks about , &quot; How did you feel in the last question , &quot; How did you feel
&quot; How was your journey to Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
These are two very different ways of living self , and remembering self , and that remembering both is part of the divergence of happiness .
Well , that remembering self is a storyteller .
And that &apos;s really beginning to start with a basic response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t just tell stories , if we make us tell stories .
Our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
And let &apos;s start with an example .
There is an old study .
These are the patients that are very painful procedure .
I &apos;m not going to go to the details . It &apos;s not painful , but it was painful as this study done in the 1990s .
They were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain stories .
And here are two patients . These are their records .
And you &apos;re asked , &quot; Who of both has more ? &quot;
And this is a very simple question .
Patient B has been clearly more . His maligned , the patient was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient B , and more .
But again , there &apos;s another question : &quot;
And here &apos;s a surprise .
And the surprise is that the patient , A lot of worse remember had a lot of bad reflection as a patient .
The stories of representations were different , and because a very crucial part of the story , as it ends .
And not one of these stories is very frightened or great -- but one of them is that clear -- but one of them is much worse than the other .
And the one that was worse , where the pain was at the end on its height . It &apos;s a bad story .
Where do we know that ?
Because we asked these people about their gut , and also much later , &quot; How bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
And she was much worse for A way for A to remember .
Now this is a direct conflict between the living self and the self and the self .
For example , living self , B had clearly had a bad time .
Now , what you could do with the patient A , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made in clinical experiments , and it works , you could actually be the representatives of the patient , just by giving up a very much .
That will lead the patient , but just a little bit and a lot less than before .
And if you do that for a few minutes , you find that the living self is that the living self from A worse , and you have a lot better story , because there &apos;s a lot better story , because now you have a better story about your experience .
What is a story ?
And this is true for the stories that are given us , and it &apos;s true for the stories that we &apos;re invent .
As a story is a story that &apos;s breakthroughs , meaningful eye crops and angels .
It &apos;s very , very important , and in this case , the end .
Well , that &apos;s alive .
It &apos;s got eye looking at life , one after the other .
And you ask , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really simple . They &apos;re lost for forever .
I mean , most sight of our lives -- and I &apos;ve been talking about this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , which means that there is about three seconds , and what means you know is that there is about 600,000 , most of them don &apos;t leave the trace .
Most of them will be completely ignored by the self .
And yet , kind of impression that they should count that what &apos;s happened during that eye is our lives .
It &apos;s the limited resource that we use during the world .
And as we use it seemed to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that remembering self self for us .
So we remembering ourselves ourselves and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
The biggest difference between them is about time .
At the point of self living , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as the first one , then the second week is the two a.e.
So this doesn &apos;t work at all , it doesn &apos;t work for
It &apos;s a second to the self is a secondary greatly hardly better than the one-sixtapy vacation , because there &apos;s no new memory .
They don &apos;t changed the story .
And in this way , time , the critical variable , which is the critical variable of self from a living self . time has very little impact on this story .
Well , that remembering self is more than remember and telling stories .
It &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , which is going to say two types of representatives in two different surgeons , and he decides what he &apos;s going to choose , then the one who is less bad , and this is the surgeon is less the fear , and this is the surgeon
It doesn &apos;t have a voice in this choice .
Actually , we don &apos;t choose between experience . We choose between memories of experiences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as a experience .
We think about our future as predicting memories .
And basically you can see this , you know , as a Tyrannei of the self , and you can think of self self , and you can think of self as one , which is , like the living self through experiences that don &apos;t need .
And I have the impression that if we do this is very often the case , that &apos;s what we do is , we &apos;re making urbanized by the service of self remembering self .
And that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , I think .
I mean , how much honor of our memories ?
This is one of the explanation that is given for the tolerance of the self .
And when I think about it , I think of a vacation that we did a couple of years ago in Antarctica , the best judgment was that I &apos;d ever had , and I think I &apos;ve ever had , and I think I had a little bit about how often I think of other
And I &apos;m probably from my memories of this three-silly journey , I would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I ever had opened the line up with the 600 images that I &apos;ve spent a little bit of an hour .
Well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s at least one and a half hours .
There seems to be a disagreement .
Now , I like a little bit extremely , you know , you know , it &apos;s like , I have a little bit of memories , but even if you make more of them , there &apos;s a real question , why do we give memories so much about the weight that we share ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine the next vacation , you know , you know that at the end of the copies are all of your images , and you get an amnic drug that you &apos;re not going to be remembered .
Now , would you choose the same urb ? And if you &apos;re going to vote a different urlaub , there &apos;s a conflict between your species of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think you can get an answer . And if you think you &apos;re going to get an answer , and if you &apos;re
Why we expose the urbanism that we &apos;re looking for is a problem with a choice between the two species of self .
Now , the two types of self throw two words out happiness .
There are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is this alive ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the eyeats in the life of self ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measured ?
And , by the way , we &apos;re unable to get a pretty good idea from happiness of the living self over time .
If you ask the happiness of the self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
It &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
It &apos;s a sense of how satisfying or satisfaction is to think about their life .
Very different term .
Every one that isn &apos;t different from the study of happiness , and I belongs to a lot of researchers , and I hear a lot of researchers on well-mated with a lot of researchers , which is a lot of researchers have
The distinction between happiness of the living self and the satisfaction of the self has been recognized in the last years , and now you &apos;re being able to measure the two separate .
The gallup organs has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked to questions about what they think about their lives and about their experience , and there were other efforts in the direction .
So in the last years , we started learning about happiness of the two species of the self .
And the main lesson that we have learned is that they &apos;re really different .
You can know how satisfaction someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach them how happy his life and reverse .
Just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about .5 .
What that means is that if you meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father &apos;s a two-meter man , how much would you know about its size ?
Well , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
They have so much uncertainty .
If I tell you that someone his life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of insecurity about how happy he is with his living self with his living self .
So the correlation is lower .
We know something about what the satisfaction of happiness self .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness is mostly to be satisfied to be happy with people we like to spend time on people we like .
There are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
So if you &apos;re lucky to be able to maximize happiness in the end , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
And the conclusion of what I said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really be lucky than a lot of well-being .
It &apos;s a completely different term .
Well , very , very short , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t see on the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
So if you ask the simple question , as happy people in California , you &apos;re not going to get the right answer .
If you think this question you think that people have to be in California are happier if you , say , we live in Ohio .
And what &apos;s going on is that when you think about life in California , you think about the difference between California and other places , and this difference , let &apos;s say in the climate .
Well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important to
Now , because the idea of self is responsible , you can on the end -- some people could go to California at the end -- some people
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to follow what &apos;s going on with people who are coming to California in hope .
Well , their life will not be happy .
We know that .
But one thing is going to happen . They will think they &apos;re more happy , because if they &apos;re going to think about it , like the weather in Ohio , and they feel that they made the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and I hope , I &apos;ll have a sense of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question to you .
Thank you .
Now , when we talked a couple of weeks before a couple of weeks ago , that there was a pretty interesting result that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this guide .
Is this something that you can share with us because you have a few minutes right now ?
Daniel Kahnman : Sure .
I think the most interesting results that we found in the Gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect .
We found that in terms of happiness of the living self .
If we looked at how emotions with the income .
And it turns out that under a income from 600,000 dollars a year , for Americans , and this is a very big probe of Americans , and that &apos;s a very large number of Americans , but it &apos;s a major representatives of 600,000 dollars a year .
CA : 60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year year , people are unhappy , and they will become more unhappy , ever they will .
We get a absolutely flat line .
I mean , I &apos;ve seen so rarely lines .
What &apos;s obvious happens is that money doesn &apos;t reveal a experience of happiness , but that lack of money is certainly intricate , and we can measure this image very , very , very clearly .
In the sense of the other self , remembering self , you get a different story .
The more money you deserve the more happy you are .
That &apos;s not the emotion .
CA : But Danny , all the American pollen is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
If people take this and seriously , I mean , I mean , it seems to make everything that we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
Is there a chance of politicians that the country would actually take a ffund and how seriously and how much of politics ?
DK : You know , I think there &apos;s recognition for the role of happiness research in politics .
The recognition will be slow into the United States , no question , but in the U.K. , it &apos;s just going to happen and in other countries .
People are beginning to realize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore the experience happiness or whether they want to explore .
As you can increase happiness in a very different depending on how you think , and if you think of the self or if you think about the living self , or if you think of the living self .
That will affect politics , I think , in the years .
In the United States , you &apos;re trying to measure the experience of the population .
That will be , I think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me , this topic is going to be the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
Thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
Thank you , Danny Kahneman .
Today I &apos;m going to talk to you today about energy and climate .
And that may be a little bit surprising , because my full-time is mostly about vaccines and hire the things that we need to reinvent the things that we need to reinvent the poorest two billion dollars a better life .
But energy and click is extremely important for these
climate change means that many years that their seats can &apos;t grow over many years , we &apos;re too much or too little rain , and things are going to change the way that their fragile environment .
That leads to dog extinction . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to uncertainty .
So , it will be dreadful for them .
And it &apos;s also very important for them .
In fact , if you could only do the prize of the prize , the permutation would be energy at far more effective .
Well , the power of all the time .
In fact , the reverse society is based on energy .
The coal evolutions in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in case in the 20th century , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
So we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But if we cut the price -- we let the price -- let &apos;s cut up to a new barrier , and we get these barriers with CO2 .
CO2 warmed the planet and the equation for CO2 is actually quite clear .
They summed up this CO2 , which leads to temperate the temperature , and it has a few very negative impact on the weather and maybe even worse , and maybe worse , which is the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt so that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t fix these changes .
Now , the exactic relationship between a carbon increase , and the refined temperature , and where the other consequences are because there &apos;s a few inclarity , but not a lot .
And there &apos;s certainly unclear about how bad that will be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
I asked the top-scientist , I asked the top , &quot; Do we really get down to zero ?
Not for half or half or a quarter ? &quot;
The answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes on .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than say , we have a 3.5 feet tall trucks , who has to get under three feet of high trucks , and then you can kind of look at it .
That &apos;s got to the bottom , on zero .
Now , every year we &apos;re picking carbon dioxide out of 26 billion tons .
Every American about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
In average , it &apos;s average about five tons of the planet .
And somehow we have to bring change that to zero .
It &apos;s been confined in time .
Only different economic changes have been influenced at all , and we have to go from raping the rise , and we have to go to zero .
This equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication . They have this thing on the left -- CO2 -- that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be dependent by the number of people in the average energy for every single person in the average energy for every single person in the average energy .
So , let &apos;s look at every factor and
Probably , one of these numbers very close to zero .
Now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
First we have the population .
Today , 6.8 billion people live .
They &apos;re on 9 billion to move up to nine billion .
If we &apos;ve been very successful with new vaccinations , the health care and reproductive medicine medicine medicine , we could think that &apos;s about 10 to 15 percent , but at the time we see a storation for 1.3 .
The second factor are the service that we use .
It &apos;s all the things that we eat , we eat , clothing .
These are very good things and poverty reduction means to make this service almost every one on the planet .
It &apos;s great that number goes up .
In the far world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do less use , but in average , this number is going to get more than doubling every year , and more than doubling every year , the number of service that will be provided per person .
Here &apos;s a very fundamental service service . Are there at home of light so you can read the homework ?
And these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school .
Now , in efficiency , the E , the energy per service , there &apos;s actually good news .
We have something that goes up .
There are many different kinds of success in the light , through other auotts , through new practices , there are a lot of services that can be dramatically , they can become dramatically , they can become dramatically , 103 : 5,05 : &apos; 05 : 50,000 people &apos; 5,,05 : 50,000 thousand thousand services have been to reduce 90 percent .
Some individual service will reduce over 90 percent .
In other services , like the manufacturing of feration , 105 : 05 : 05 : 56 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 5,000 or the air traffic is much smaller .
Well , by all , if we are optimistic , maybe we get a reduction to a factor three or maybe even around a factor .
But at the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons , and it &apos;s just not enough .
So , let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will
It turns out the question if you can get to the zero .
If you &apos;re coal , no .
If you &apos;re burning gas : No .
Almost every technique for electricity today is CO2 , except the renewable energy and nuclear .
So , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
We need energy wells .
Now , if I use miracle &quot; , &quot; I don &apos;t mean the impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The PC is a miracle .
The Internet and the service is a miracle .
The people here have contributed to the development of many of this miracle .
If you don &apos;t have deadline that you need a miracles to a particular date .
Except , you &apos;re just just right , and some other people don &apos;t .
In this case , we have to have collapse and get a miracle in very short time .
Now , I asked myself , how can I really remove this ?
Is there a natural illucture , a demonstration that shows the idea of people here ?
I remembered that last year , when I brought mosquitoes and kind of like people .
The idea was really tangible , you know that there are people who live with mosquitoes .
For energy , I noticed this .
I decided that the freak of light , my wife would be the environment here .
So here are some of
You told me that they didn &apos;t know . In fact , they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
Well , there are all kinds of play out like this , but they all don &apos;t bring a lot .
We need solutions , either one or several people who are going to have a number of inclusive , and even though there are a lot of directions where people are looking at , I really only see five who can afford this big requirements .
I have times , praothermal , fusion and bio-resources .
This may be a moderate contribution , and if they do better than I expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them because they shake us , because all have significant problems .
Let &apos;s first take a look at the burning fossil fuels , by either coal or natural gas .
What you have to have to do is maybe just , but it &apos;s not . You have to get all the CO2 that &apos;s going to get out of the chornstein , and then hope that it staying in there .
There are some piloted projects that can be on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of Niveau , but it &apos;s getting up to 100 percent , and a persuasion for the CO2 is going to have a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is to make a big challenge . But the biggest problem here is
Who will make it safe ?
Who can &apos;t guarantee what literally billions of times greater than any kind of garbage that you can think of nuclear and other things ?
That &apos;s a lot of people .
So this is a hard nut .
The next thing : nuclear power .
It also has three big problems , the cost , especially in high-powered countries , and the question for security , and the question for security that you really feel that there &apos;s nothing going to be used to be used for weapons .
And what do you do with the waste ?
Because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of evidence .
People have to feel good at this time .
So three very difficult problems that maybe are solubble , and that &apos;s why to work .
The last three of the five I got together .
These are the laterable energy , as they &apos;re often called .
And the other people have -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some notes .
One is the energy diverse that these technologies are making wireless .
These are energy poor , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square kilometers , over thousands of times more space than a normal thing .
And it &apos;s also underlying these sources subway .
The Sun doesn &apos;t seem to all day , it doesn &apos;t seem like every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem like the wind .
That &apos;s why you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way that &apos;s energy in the time when you &apos;re not available to get
So there are very
And there &apos;s a problem .
And to show the dimension , I &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made of batteries , looking for the computer , cell phones , TM pamping , for all , and this is what I &apos;ve done with the amount of the electronic energy that we can produce the world , but I found out that all the batteries that we &apos;re going to produce less than 10 minutes of the total energy .
So we need a huge breakthrough there
That &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
This happens when you try to try this underbrowse over 20 percent of the consumer .
If you want to keep up 100 percent of it , you need an incredible heat battery .
Now , where do we want to go , what is the right approach ?
A project ? How do we come to the goal ?
What we need is a lot of companies working on this .
In every one of these five parts , we need at least 100 people .
You &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! That &apos;s good .
I think there in TED group , there &apos;s a lot of people who are already engaged there .
Bill Gross has several companies , under one named eSolar has the great solar solar therlands .
Vod Khosla invested in dozens companies that make great things and have interesting ways to support this .
Nathan Myhrvold , and I funding a company that , maybe surprising , the nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in the nuclear range ; modular , liquid .
The development has stopped in this industry in front of some time , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good conclude .
The Terrace Power-concept concept means that you instead of the U235 , we decided to burn one percent , the U235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , we decided to burn U238 .
This is a pretty crazy idea .
But in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simulate whether it would work , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material , it looks like that it &apos;s working .
And because you &apos;ve run this 99 percent , the cost is much better .
In fact , you &apos;re harvesting the garbage , and you can actually use the reactors as a wheelevator .
Instead of breaking on the head , you just burn it . It &apos;s just a great thing .
The urbanism is going to have a little bit like a candle .
You can see that it &apos;s a kind of mammals , often called &quot; migration wave reactor . &quot;
That really solving the fuel problem .
Here &apos;s a picture of an area in Kentucky .
This is the accident that the 99 percent , you have the part that &apos;s been burned in today , so it means that it &apos;s been consuming .
The U.S. for hundreds of years .
And if you think it &apos;s cheap and just film , you get rid of fuel for the rest of the planet .
You know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
Let &apos;s look at how we should measure our success .
What should we look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach , and then we talk about the clay .
Many are talking about a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
It &apos;s really important that we get there .
The rest 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , and still something agriculture is going to be clean , and after that .
So to reach those 80 percent , the developed world needs to put in the developed world , including countries like China , their electricity electricity production .
The other note says , whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we are on the path to get them to the rest .
That &apos;s great .
That will be a key key to this stuff .
If we go back from there , what is the 2020 witness ?
It should have the two elements again .
We should use the effects of efficiency in order to bring reduction to the way , the less we emitate , the less we emitate , and the temperature .
But in fact , this note is for the things that we do not lead to the big rejections , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
This is a breakthroughs , we have to purchasing gas , and we can measure it , in the piloted projects and regulations change .
There are many great books to this topic .
The Al Gore &apos;s book , &quot; We have the choice and David McKays &quot; Sustainable Energy Without Air . &quot;
They &apos;re really going through it and create a framework that can be discussed by all sides .
There &apos;s a single thing that has to come together .
That &apos;s a wish .
A very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
If you only one wish for the next 50 years , I could choose the president , a vaccine , a vaccine , and I love , or I could choose the president , a vaccine , and I would take this wish , and I took that wish .
This has the biggest impact .
If we don &apos;t get that wish , it &apos;s going to be horrified in the long term and shortcutting-edge people are terrible , between the U.S. and China , between the United States and China , almost all of these two billion will be much worse .
So what do we need to do ?
So , for what do I use ?
We need to use this for more research .
If countries are in places like Khalfway , they should not just talk about CO2 .
You should say , these innovations , and you would be swallowed by the ridiculously yellow yellow for these innovations .
We need marketplace , CO2 tax , Cap &amp; amp ; amp ; Trade is something that a prize is creating .
We have to spread the message .
We need to dialogue a dialogue of dialogue , and the things that are done by the government .
It &apos;s an important desire , but I think we can do it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
So thank you very much . Just
Bill Gates : Well , to take the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million . And even if we tested our materials into a Russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s going to work , you only in the 10 million .
The hard step is the weak of the first reactor , to find another billion , the representations actually built the first place of it .
As soon as the first first finished when it works as it works as well , everything is very clear , because the economy , the endity , the energy is so different than nuclear power , as we know them .
CA : Well , to understand this right : that means deep into the ground , almost like a verticultural fuel , this was using Us , and then the process starts working on the bottom ?
BG : ExExactly . Today , you have to have to fill the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and a lot of control that can go wrong , and it &apos;s not good . It &apos;s good . It &apos;s not good
But if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- you think of a millennia -- think of a millennia -- you think of a little bit more complex .
And it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s finished .
CA : A nuclear reactor that provides a solution for the garbage .
BG : Yeah . Well , what &apos;s going on with the garbage , you can leave it -- there &apos;s a lot less garbage with this method -- take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it up .
And we start by by taking the garbage that &apos;s already there that &apos;s a lot of refrifrigering in the reactors , and this is our gun , which is our gun to do .
So this is what this reactor was a problem , which is what we put in in our , and it &apos;s reduced dramatically during this process .
CA : But while you &apos;ve talked about different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , so what &apos;s the biggest interest ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t put us on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting offspring for everything that &apos;s called the nuclear &quot; in the name , &quot; in the name . There are big interest and the people of the entrepreneurs were in Russia , India , China ... I was here , and I made the energy being there and talked about how
I am optimistic . You know , the French and made a little bit of the direction .
This is a variation of one thing that was made .
This is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built this , which is why everyone who has a quick reactor in our first .
CA : In your mind : timescrow and likelihood that really come into life ?
BG : Well , we need one of these magnificent things that are very affordable , we have 20 years to come in and then 20 years .
This is kind of the deadline that we have to have the environmental models that we have to have .
And , you know TerraPower , if everything works well , and this is a big wish , it could be easy .
And luckily , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of people who , as if their approaches work that can offer .
And it would be the best if you can use multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
On the case , we need a solution .
CA : Have the big breakthroughs , this is the size that you know ?
BG : It &apos;s the most important thing .
That would have been so much more important .
In the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s a modular method that &apos;s another approach .
There &apos;s a liquid retrospital reputation that seems hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there &apos;s different , but it &apos;s a nice thing about a million times as much energy has a million times as much energy as a coal , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and that are mostly the radiation , the footprint , the footprint and the cost , the footprint , the footprint on the land and other things , almost a liga sense .
CA : If that &apos;s not clear , what ?
Do we need the emergency purposes to try to keep the natural temperature in order to keep the
BG : If you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much , and shortly before a heart attack . What do you do ? You need a heart surgery or something .
There &apos;s a research device called geoengineering , which is called its global warming with different techniques to move forward to global warming warming , so that we have 20 or 30 years longer to deal with us 20 or 30 years longer .
That &apos;s just a insurance method .
You hope that we don &apos;t need that .
Some people say , you &apos;re not going to work at first , because you know , maybe you &apos;re going to keep working , because you know , you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
I don &apos;t know if this is a smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in gear , there &apos;s a discourse in gear , whether you should have to have the things faster , or that innovation need longer than we &apos;re expecting the faster , or that innovation , as we expect .
CA : Climate , do you have a number or two sentences to persuade you to
BG : Well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
Those who do the scientific arguments are very little .
Tell that there are negative effects to do with the clouds that are changing ?
There are very , very few things that you can even say that there are a chance in a million .
The main problem here is as similar to AIDS .
You make the mistake , and you pay for a lot later .
And that &apos;s why the idea of now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems , in something that you only have later what -- and this is that the investing is not so clear . In the IPC Report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC , and say okay , this is not a big drama .
The fact is that this uncertainty we should worry .
But my dream here is that if you can do it to make economic , and at the same time , the skeptics say , &quot; Okay , you know , it &apos;s not a CO2 , I wish almost that it &apos;s the day , but I &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
CA : And that would be your answer to the Bjurn Lomborg argument , that if you use all this time and energy to solve the CO2 problem , all the other tartargets suffer of malaria and so on that it &apos;s a dumb use of malaria and so on that it &apos;s a dumb use of the resources that we can do .
BG : Well , the actual research -- this is not so dramatically the U.S. 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatically .
There should not suffer from other things .
You get to a large amount of money , and you can disagree with people who , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . For me , for me ,
It &apos;s because you &apos;re very short ago , you &apos;re very , very , very short ago , and I think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheap .
If you &apos;re going to get , a very high energy episode is a very high energy .
I mean , every one of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing their lifestyle .
For those two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
And even Lomborg thinks about .
His new measures now , &quot; Why is not going to do this anymore ? &quot;
He &apos;s still going to be because of his previous stories , with the Skeper Camp , but he understood that this is a very infinite group , and therefore he &apos;s now bringing the research argument .
And this is a mindset that I think is appropriate .
The research , it &apos;s just crazy about how little that will support .
CA : Bill , I think , for almost all people here , if I say , I really hope that your wish is true . Thank you very much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what I &apos;d like a few months ago in the writing of an array for Italian Wired .
I &apos;ve always done my sync dictionaries , but I was in the writing of text , but I was with the leg of the text , and I noticed that I had never been in my life , which means what the word &quot; really means . &quot;
I &apos;m going to read the entry .
&quot; Adjetively , &quot; adjective : &quot; Soviet , helpful , useless , distorted , extinct , diminded , separated , lahm , separated , lahm , separated , serving , distorted , partified , paralyzed hanging , gging , paralyzed hanapdged , drilled .
Anonymous : legislation , strong . &quot;
I read this list of a friend who had to laugh , and I had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but I just came up until &quot; and couldn &apos;t stop talking , and I had to gather talk , and I had to collect first a little bit of the emotional shock .
Of course , this was a celebrating , old sync dictionary , and I just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
But , in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s , when I started working with elementary school , and to build my self-assemble outside of my family &apos;s family and the rest of the world around me .
And thank God , I haven &apos;t used to be a synthetic dictionary .
If I have this mission mission seriously , I would be born in a world that someone could perceive myself as a person whose life can run in the world , but today I &apos;m going to go for the opportunities and adventures that I &apos;ve seen .
So I immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and I expected that I find one of the contribution .
Here &apos;s the current version of this one-to-face .
It &apos;s not much better .
In particular , the last two words of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
But it &apos;s not just the words .
It &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
It &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
Our language affect our thinking , and as we see the world and the people around us .
A lot of alternatal societies , including the Greeks and the tube , have really believed that the expression of a flight is a big force because what you can call out of a great force because what you can
So , what do we really want to manipulate -- a human being ?
In fact , a human being seen as a child as a child , could be enough to disguiding them in the world .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open to you ?
A man who owned up for me , was my kinderburst on A.I. Dupont instit in Wilmington in Delaware .
It &apos;s called Dr. Pizendoo . A Italo Americans whose name , as you can think most Americans couldn &apos;t think were correct , and so he was going to be Dr. Pizza .
And Dr. P. used to
I found the time that I spent in this hospital , just great -- until my physicotherapy .
And I had to find that I had to come up with this dicks , change in different colors -- you know , in different colors -- you know , you know , to build my bands more than anything else , and I hated them . I hated it .
And imagine , in front of me actually , as a five-year-old kid with Dr. P. and tried to stop this exercising natural without success .
And one day , he looked at me at one day , he was just tired and he said , &quot; Wow , Aimee , and he said to me , &quot; Wow , Aimee , you &apos;re so powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to run one day .
And if you get it , I &apos;m going to give hundreds of dollars . &quot;
That was , of course , just a simple trick by Dr. P. so I didn &apos;t want to do with the extent that I didn &apos;t want to do , with the exception that was five-year-olds in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my everyday horror horror with new eyes .
And I wonder today , how much his vision of mine has been a strong , and I could think of my own self-imaging , and I could imagine as a nature of staring , powerful and atlethal man .
That &apos;s just one example of many , like adults in power in power , the imagination of a child .
But the way that already included examples of the synonymous dictionaries , we don &apos;t think our language is not a space , to imagine what we &apos;d all wish is a powerful person to see themselves as powerful people .
Our language back to the social change that &apos;s been solved in many cases by a technological change change in many cases .
Of course , you can see , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgy surgy for vision , kneck from Titan and artistic hatred for alternative bodies that allow people to actually use really to use all their opportunities and to create the boundaries that allow people to build all their possibilities and beyond the boring their own system to speak of networking in their own ways ,
And in the world &apos;s part of the world that they &apos;re looking for themselves .
So maybe illustrates this technological change is a little bit of this technology has always been a different truth , that every person of the society can be something special and very stuff , and it &apos;s the human ability to adapt , and that the human ability to adapt , our
The human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people ask me about how I go with Withthout , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit about , this sentence for never , and I &apos;m going to feel very uncomfortable with the questions of people to answer , and I think I really know why .
This sentence from the idea that success of the idea that success or happiness is dependent on the idea that success or happiness is dependent on the remaining experience of being preventing , and as if my life succeeded , and as if my life has been successful , because I could do the potential for all of a life with a prosthesis , or whatever I do with my disability .
But the truth is that we &apos;re changing . Of course , we &apos;re concerned about the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally or even both of us , whether it &apos;s
And I &apos;m saying that this is good .
Withthout , there &apos;s no evidence that we have to deal with our lives better .
Withthout to our lives .
And I tend to see Without my shadow .
And sometimes I realize that he &apos;s very embarrassed to see sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s all the time .
And I want to make the impact .
There are challenges in life , and there &apos;s challenges , and it &apos;s just to be real , and every person &apos;s not about it , but the question is not whether we come with Withthout , or not , but as we get clear to it .
So we &apos;re not only responsible for the people that we love to maintain despread , but they also prey to come up with it so well .
And we don &apos;t prove our children that they can &apos;t adapt .
You have to run two things clear : to a medical fact , to be a medical opinion about whether I &apos;m disabled or not .
And to be honest , the only real and the disability , with which I had to share with me is that the world , it can describe me to this definitions .
In our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and the cold , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a prediction about their medical forecast , or even a forecast that we don &apos;t have to rely on the ground , we don &apos;t have to
Maybe this is a concept that &apos;s just looking at what is broken in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single single single disability than the pathology .
If we &apos;re not treating a human being now , and not all of its forces and possibilities and opportunities , we can create a lot more disease .
We degrade a human being that has value for our society .
So we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all of human possibilities .
But the most important thing is that there is between the perception of our intrigues and our great inventations .
We should not use this more challenging times or deny , we should not try to avoid them , we should not try to avoid them , we should go under the carpet , but it &apos;s about being able to recognize them .
It may seem to be clear to me to realize that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome , but that we &apos;re going to have to be open , and to be able to use it as well .
And maybe we can be able to see Without , as something natural , true , and we feel like that through their presence .
In this year we celebrate the 200 , birthday of Charles Darwin and when he wrote over 150 years ago , and when he wrote over 150 years ago , on something very true in the human character .
I would write it so that &apos;s not the strongest type of survivors , and not the intelligent occasions of his kind , but the thing that can adapt changes best .
In conflict , creativity .
It &apos;s not just Darwin &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of the human mind is to survive and floating , by changing the battle of the human spirit is to convert through conflict .
So again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
And maybe we don &apos;t know what wood we have been being tested .
Maybe that &apos;s exactly the sense of measurements , a sense for our own power .
We can give us a little ourselves .
We can give a new meaning that goes beyond times .
Maybe we can see Widrivers change .
Without to change that we have not adapted .
I think the biggest damage that we added ourselves is to is to believe that we should be normal .
Now , who is normal ?
There &apos;s no Normal .
There is the kind of thing . The cellular . But not the norms . And
I don &apos;t think more .
It would be great , if we think this paradigm of normal choices , or the strength , in order to simulate even a little bit more dangerous , we can use the forces of a lot of children , and they can invite their special and valuable skills in society .
Anthylacines have found that we &apos;ve always asked people about the members of our society has always been asked to afford to make a contribution .
There &apos;s evidence that &apos;s already , the Neanderthals are already , 60,000 years ago , and people with severely physical injury , and this may have been because the life experience in the lives of these people in society .
They didn &apos;t look as a broken and used to use ; they have been treated as something special and
A few years ago , I went into the city where I grew up in a living market in the Red Zone in the northeast of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of Pennsylvania , and I stood in front of a paper .
It was summer , and I had Shorts .
And I hear a guy behind me , &quot; Well , if that &apos;s not Aimee Mullins . &quot;
And I turn around and see this older man , I had no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? I can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , you can barely remember me .
When I first first looked at you , I took you out of the leg of your mother . &quot;
Oh , so that .
And of course , it has made it click .
This was Dr. Kean , a man I just knew about narratives of my mother over this day , because I was , of course , came to my birthday for two weeks .
The doctor for a representations of my mother was in the judgment of my father , and so my parents knew who brought me to the world , not at all .
And because I was born without acquired , and my feet had been reported , and I just a few toes a couple of toes on this , and a few toes on this person who had to get the bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to say that you would never walk , and you &apos;d never walk , and never be as moving as the children or that you can never live an independent life , and since you &apos;ve just been able to lie . &quot;
Really , I found that he gathered newspapers in my entire childhood , no no matter whether I had won at a letter in the second class , whether I had a shrinking competition in the parade of the parade to Halthloans , and he used this exposure , whether I had a portal sevenues , and he used this excelled student , and he used this excites to teach their profits .
And he called this part of his course , X factor , the potential welcome .
You can &apos;t just emphasize enough , like the crucial one factor can be a human life .
And Dr. Kean went on , he said , &quot; I &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get told anything else , and even though they get a little bit of support , if you leave kids can do a lot . &quot;
Look , Dr. Kean has changed mind .
He understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody goes around with it , two different things are different .
And I also changed my mind at the time , when they asked me at the age 15 , whether I would have my prothread my samples of meat , and then I would have no doubt for a second .
I was very normal .
If you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , WEIL , I have a little bit with my legs and not TROTZ of these experiences .
And maybe that change could happen because I &apos;m so many people who have been given to me so many people who were going to have the doors , rather than given people who wanted me to have an idea .
See , it really only needs one people who demonstrate how you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
If you ensure someone to activate your inner forces -- the human mind is so sensitive -- the human mind is so sensitive -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
They bring them to themselves to open themselves .
The real meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; in the word &quot; educe . &quot;
It means to teach something that in a way that you can see the potential .
Again , what the potential do we want to call it ?
In the &apos; 60s , in the U.K. , in the &apos; 60s , Gymnasia in the &apos; 60s .
You call that &quot; Streaming trials in the United States , we call this as &quot; Tracking . &quot;
Students are divided after grades .
And the A students will be
And then you have over a three-monkey period of students with a &quot; Except , &quot; the Note , &quot; and it &apos;s been told that they were very clever , they were very clever , and after these three months , they really written by three months .
And of course , it &apos;s crushed to hear that reverse was told that it was just enough .
And then , after the three months .
But just the ones that were still in school -- except for the students who were missing school .
The only thing that happened in this study , that teachers were not taught .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
They were just told that the serendipitous students and that are the students with the note , and they taught them something , and they taught them .
The only real disability is a broken spirit , has been a mind that &apos;s been broken , no hope . He doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful , and it doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful .
But if we create it to support the human mind , keep trying to find themselves and be able to find themselves and find other people in order to be beautiful , recently , to be able to be able to make our forces really positive .
If you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new wires .
I want to end with a poem that was a persist by a persist called Hafiz in the 14th century , and the poem is called &quot; The God said , &quot; The God , who only knows four words . And the poem is called &quot; The God knows , &quot; Every kid knows not the name of the God , but the four words who only knows four words , and they always tell me ,
Come , dance with me . Thank you .
